abstract = {Telemetry has major potential for application to fish habitat science and management, but to date it is underutilized in this regard. We posit this is because (1) fish telemetry projects are often geared towards detecting fish movement, opposed to systematically sampling habitat selection, and (2) there are often differences in scale between telemetry data and management decisions. We discuss various ways in which telemetry can contribute to fish habitat science and present some considerations for improving its application to this field. To date, most fish telemetry studies have been descriptive (e.g., fish use area A more than area B); greater adoption of more inferential study approaches that assess causal ecological drivers of movement and space use would be of value and require more extensive measurement of environmental conditions. We conclude by presenting a conceptual framework for scaling from individual studies to broad applications in habitat management. Established telemetry networks can readily support synthesis activities, although fish tracking data and environmental data are rarely stored together, and current disconnects among repositories may constrain broad integration and scalability.}

abstract = {The reproductive biology and other life-history parameters were investigated for Mustelus asterias in British waters, with specimens caught from both commercial fisheries and research-vessel surveys. In total, 504 specimens [238 males, 24-99 cm total length ({LT}) and 266 females, 28-124 cm {LT}] were examined, with further information collected from 238 uterine pups. The lengths at 50\% maturity were estimated as 70·4 and 81·9 cm {LT} for males and females, respectively. Ovarian fecundity ranged from one to 28, and uterine fecundity from four to 20. The number, mass and {LT} of pups were positively correlated with maternal {LT}. Full-term pups ranged from 205 to 329 mm {LT}, and the smallest free-living fish caught was 24 cm {LT} . Parturition occurred in February in the western English Channel and during June to July in the eastern English Channel and southern North Sea, indicating either protracted spawning or asynchronous parturition for the stock as a whole. The reproductive cycle is thought to extend beyond 1 year. Developmental abnormalities observed included atresia in oocytes, uterine eggs that failed to develop, a partly developed pup and an abnormal male with a single aberrant clasper. Data relating to conversion factors, oocyte numbers and diameter and gonado-somatic and hepato-somatic indices are presented, and the seasonality of the reproductive cycle is discussed. \copyright 2015 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.}

abstract = {Commercial landings of starry smooth-hound Mustelus asterias in northern European seas are increasing, whilst our knowledge of their ecology, behaviour and population structure remains limited. M. asterias is a widely distributed demersal shark, occupying the waters of the southern North Sea and Irish Sea in the north, to at least the southern Bay of Biscay in the south, and is seasonally abundant in {UK} waters. There are no species-specific management measures for the northeast Atlantic stock, and the complexity of its population structure is not yet fully understood. To address this issue, we deployed both mark-recapture and electronic tags on M. asterias to gain novel insights into its horizontal and vertical movements. Our data suggest that the habitat use of M. asterias changes on a seasonal basis, with associated changes in geographical distribution, depth utilisation and experienced temperature. We report the first direct evidence of philopatry for this species, and also provide initial evidence of sex-biased dispersal and potential metapopulation-like stock structuring either side of the {UK} continental shelf. Investigations of finer-scale vertical movements revealed clear diel variation in vertical activity. The illustrated patterns of seasonal space-use and behaviour will provide important information to support the stock assessment process and will help inform any future management options.}

abstract = {The primary aim of this long-term angler-led tagging programme was to gain information about seasonal changes in distribution of the starry smooth-hound shark Mustelus asterias, along the Dutch coast for management and conservation purposes. Between 2011 and 2014, M. asterias comprised 92·6\% (n = 2418) of the total elasmobranch catch (n = 2612) by the licenced group of taggers within the Dutch Delta of which 2244 M. asterias were fin-tagged with plastic rototags. Sex and total length ({LT} ) composition inside the eastern tidal basin (Oosterschelde) were significantly different, i.e. more females and larger individuals, than outside indicating a pupping ground, which was confirmed by the capture of 30 newborn pups (≤32 cm). The distribution pattern of reported recaptured M. asterias (return-rate 3·6\%, n = 80) showed a circannual migration between summering in the southern North Sea and wintering in the English Channel and the Bay of Biscay, and suggests that M. asterias is philopatric. The Dutch angling season for M. asterias runs from approximately mid-May to mid-October when the water temperature is above 13° C. Recaptures of eight mature females, but no males in the Bay of Biscay, indicate partial spatial segregation by sex, where mature females migrate over larger distances than immature females and males. These observations, with the absence of recaptures in other known summering areas (i.e. the Irish Sea and Bristol Channel), suggest that the southern North Sea is used by a separate population. Implications for management and recommendations to improve and expand the study approach are discussed. \copyright 2016 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.}
