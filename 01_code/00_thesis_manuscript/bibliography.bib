abstract = {Data visualization is regularly promoted for its ability to reveal stories within data, yet these \textquotedblleftdata stories\textquotedblright differ in important ways from traditional forms of storytelling. Storytellers, especially online journalists, have increasingly been integrating visualizations into their narratives, in some cases allowing the visualization to function in place of a written story. In this paper, we systematically review the design space of this emerging class of visualizations. Drawing on case studies from news media to visualization research, we identify distinct genres of narrative visualization. We characterize these design differences, together with interactivity and messaging, in terms of the balance between the narrative flow intended by the author (imposed by graphical elements and the interface) and story discovery on the part of the reader (often through interactive exploration). Our framework suggests design strategies for narrative visualization, including promising under-explored approaches to journalistic storytelling and educational media.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The movement of animals is strongly influenced by external factors in their surrounding environment such as weather, habitat types, and human land use. With advances in positioning and sensor technologies, it is now possible to capture animal locations at high spatial and temporal granularities. Likewise, scientists have an increasing access to large volumes of environmental data. Environmental data are heterogeneous in source and format, and are usually obtained at different spatiotemporal scales than movement data. Indeed, there remain scientific and technical challenges in developing linkages between the growing collections of animal movement data and the large repositories of heterogeneous remote sensing observations, as well as in the developments of new statistical and computational methods for the analysis of movement in its environmental context. These challenges include retrieval, indexing, efficient storage, data integration, and analytical techniques. {RESULTS}: This paper contributes to movement ecology research by presenting a new publicly available system, Environmental-Data Automated Track Annotation (Env-{DATA}), that automates annotation of movement trajectories with ambient atmospheric observations and underlying landscape information. Env-{DATA} provides a free and easy-to-use platform that eliminates technical difficulties of the annotation processes and relieves end users of a ton of tedious and time-consuming tasks associated with annotation, including data acquisition, data transformation and integration, resampling, and interpolation. The system is illustrated with a case study of Galapagos Albatross (Phoebastria irrorata) tracks and their relationship to wind, ocean productivity and chlorophyll concentration. Our case study illustrates why adult albatrosses make long-range trips to preferred, productive areas and how wind assistance facilitates their return flights while their outbound flights are hampered by head winds. {CONCLUSIONS}: The new Env-{DATA} system enhances Movebank, an open portal of animal tracking data, by automating access to environmental variables from global remote sensing, weather, and ecosystem products from open web resources. The system provides several interpolation methods from the native grid resolution and structure to a global regular grid linked with the movement tracks in space and time. The aim is to facilitate new understanding and predictive capabilities of spatiotemporal patterns of animal movement in response to dynamic and changing environments from local to global scales.}

abstract = {An optimal search theory, the so-called Lévy-flight foraging hypothesis, predicts that predators should adopt search strategies known as Lévy flights where prey is sparse and distributed unpredictably, but that Brownian movement is sufficiently efficient for locating abundant prey. Empirical studies have generated controversy because the accuracy of statistical methods that have been used to identify Lévy behaviour has recently been questioned. Consequently, whether foragers exhibit Lévy flights in the wild remains unclear. Crucially, moreover, it has not been tested whether observed movement patterns across natural landscapes having different expected resource distributions conform to the theory's central predictions. Here we use maximum-likelihood methods to test for Lévy patterns in relation to environmental gradients in the largest animal movement data set assembled for this purpose. Strong support was found for Lévy search patterns across 14 species of open-ocean predatory fish (sharks, tuna, billfish and ocean sunfish), with some individuals switching between Lévy and Brownian movement as they traversed different habitat types. We tested the spatial occurrence of these two principal patterns and found Lévy behaviour to be associated with less productive waters (sparser prey) and Brownian movements to be associated with productive shelf or convergence-front habitats (abundant prey). These results are consistent with the Lévy-flight foraging hypothesis, supporting the contention that organism search strategies naturally evolved in such a way that they exploit optimal Lévy patterns.}

However, ecology is not the only discipline interested in movement: a number of information sciences are specialising in analysis and visualisation of movement data. The recent explosion in availability and complexity of movement data has resulted in a call in ecology for new appropriate methods that would be able to take full advantage of the increasingly complex and growing data volume. One way in which this could be done is to form interdisciplinary collaborations between ecologists and experts from information sciences that analyse movement. In this paper we present an overview of new movement analysis and visualisation methodologies resulting from such an interdisciplinary research network: the European {COST} Action "{MOVE} - Knowledge Discovery from Moving Objects" (http://www.move-cost.info). This international network evolved over four years and brought together some 140 researchers from different disciplines: those that collect movement data (out of which the movement ecology was the largest represented group) and those that specialise in developing methods for analysis and visualisation of such data (represented in {MOVE} by computational geometry, geographic information science, visualisation and visual analytics). We present {MOVE} achievements and at the same time put them in ecological context by exploring relevant ecological themes to which {MOVE} studies do or potentially could contribute.}

abstract = {Remote measurement of the physiology, behaviour and energetic status of free-living animals is made possible by a variety of techniques that we refer to collectively as 'biotelemetry'. This set of tools ranges from transmitters that send their signals to receivers up to a few kilometers away to those that send data to orbiting satellites and, more frequently, to devices that log data. They enable researchers to document, for long uninterrupted periods, how undisturbed organisms interact with each other and their environment in real time. In spite of advances enabling the monitoring of many physiological and behavioural variables across a range of taxa of various sizes, these devices have yet to be embraced widely by the ecological community. Our review suggests that this technology has immense potential for research in basic and applied animal ecology. Efforts to incorporate biotelemetry into broader ecological research programs should yield novel information that has been challenging to collect historically from free-ranging animals in their natural environments. Examples of research that would benefit from biotelemetry include the assessment of animal responses to different anthropogenic perturbations and the development of life-time energy budgets.}

Here we use molecular markers to analyse the frequency of multiple paternity in two related viviparous sharks, Mustelus mustelus and Mustelus punctulatus. We first applied molecular methods to assign pregnant females, embryos and additional reference adults (N = 792) to one of the two species. Paternity analysis was performed using a total of 9 polymorphic microsatellites on 19 females and 204 embryos of M. mustelus, and on 13 females and 303 embryos of M. punctulatus. Multiple paternity occurs in both species, with 47\% of M. mustelus and 54\% of M. punctulatus litters sired by at least two fathers. Female fecundity is not influenced by multiple mating and in 56\% of polyandrous litters paternity is skewed, with one male siring most of the pups. Genetic analyses also revealed hybridization between the two species, with a M. punctulatus female bearing pups sired by a M. mustelus male. The frequency of polyandrous litters in these species is consistent with aspects of their reproductive biology, such as synchronous ovulation and possible occurrence of breeding aggregations.}

Marine and euryhaline elasmobranchs in seawater regulate urea and other body fluid solutes (trimethylamine oxide ({TMAO}), Na+, Cl−) such that they remain hyper-osmotic to their environment. Salt secretions of the rectal gland and excretions in the urine compensate for continuous inward diffusion of environmental salts. Freshwater and euryhaline elasmobranchs in fresh water synthesise less urea and retain less urea and other body fluid solutes compared to marine elasmobranchs and thus have relatively lower osmolarity. Electrolyte uptake at the gills and kidney reabsorption of salts maintain acid–base balance and ionic consistency. The role of the gills, kidney, liver and rectal gland in elasmobranch osmoregulation is reviewed. The ontogeny of osmoregulatory systems in elasmobranchs and the contribution of drinking and eating processes in maintaining osmotic consistency are discussed. Recommendations for future research are presented.}

abstract = {1. Diel vertical migration ({DVM}) is a widespread phenomenon among marine and freshwater organisms and many studies with various taxa have sought to understand its adaptive significance. Among crustacean zooplankton and juveniles of some fish species {DVM} is accepted widely as an antipredator behaviour, but little is known about its adaptive value for relatively large-bodied, adult predatory fish such as sharks. Moreover, the majority of studies have focused on pelagic forms, which raises the question of whether {DVM} occurs in bottom-living predators. 2. To investigate {DVM} in benthic predatory fish in the marine environment and to determine why it might occur we tracked movements of adult male dogfish (Scyliorhinus canicula) by short- and long-term acoustic and archival telemetry. Movement studies were complemented with measurements of prey abundance and availability and thermal habitat within home ranges. A thermal choice experiment and energy budget modelling was used to investigate trade-offs between foraging and thermal habitat selection. 3. Male dogfish undertook normal {DVM} (nocturnal ascent) within relatively small home ranges (-100 x 100 m) comprising along-bottom movements up submarine slopes from deeper, colder waters occupied during the day into warmer, shallow prey-rich areas above the thermocline at night. Few daytime vertical movements occurred. Levels of activity were higher during the night above the thermocline compared to below it during the day indicating they foraged in warm water and rested in colder depths. 4. A thermal choice experiment using environmentally realistic temperatures supported the field observation that dogfish positively avoided warmer water even when it was associated with greater food availability. Males in laboratory aquaria moved into warm water from a cooler refuge only to obtain food, and after food consumption they preferred to rest and digest in cooler water. 5. Modelling of energy budgets under different realistic thermal-choice scenarios indicated dogfish adopting a 'hunt warm - rest cool' strategy could lower daily energy costs by just over 4\%. Our results provide the first clear evidence that are consistent with the hypothesis that a benthic marine-fish predator utilizes {DVM} as an energy conservation strategy that increases bioenergetic efficiency.}

abstract = {Examination of the reproductive biology of Mustelus asterias in the north-east Atlantic Ocean highlighted apparent geographical variation in maturity, fecundity and ovarian cycle between Atlantic and Mediterranean populations. The stretch total length (L({ST}) ) and age at 50\% maturity for Atlantic males and females were estimated at 78 cm L({ST}) and 4-5 years and 87 cm L({ST}) and 6 years, respectively. Size at maturity of females was considerably smaller than in Mediterranean specimens (96 cm L({ST}) ). Ovarian fecundity ranged from eight to 27 oocytes and uterine fecundity from six to 18 embryos. The gestation period was c. 12 months, followed by a resting period of c. 12 months, resulting in a biennial cycle. Females stored sperm in the oviducal gland and, unlike Mediterranean specimens, no uterine compartments were observed in Atlantic specimens. This study reveals the existence of strong, possibly adaptive, divergence in life-history traits in an elasmobranch, whose northern populations may be more susceptible to overexploitation than previously believed. \copyright 2010 The Authors.

abstract = {Theoretical models of coastal shark populations have remained largely unchanged since the 1960s despite limitations in applicability to many species. Smaller bodied coastal species are poorly represented by the current models. A new theoretical model is proposed to represent those species that spend most or all of their life within nearshore waters but do not show use of discrete nursery areas. Description of this new model outlines the importance of nearshore areas to these smaller species. While all coastal shark populations are susceptible to environmental and anthropogenic impacts, species that fit the new model are more vulnerable to varying coastal processes, habitat degradation, and fishing pressure than are species that use nearshore areas for only part of their life-span. The dynamic nature of nearshore areas and their proximity to human populations present all sharks that occur in them with a range of advantages and disadvantages. This paper reviews how different species utilise nearshore areas and how they overcome the challenges they face in inhabiting these areas. Improving and expanding theoretical models of coastal shark populations will provide a better understanding of how sharks use nearshore environments and assist in making conservation and management decisions for these regions.}

abstract = {Exploitation of fish populations can induce evolutionary responses in life histories. For example, fisheries targeting large individuals are expected to select for early maturation at smaller sizes, leading to reduced fecundity and thus also reduced fisheries yield. These predicted phenotypic shifts have been observed in several fish stocks, but disentangling the environmental and genetic causes behind them has proved difficult. Here, we review recent studies investigating phenotypic shifts in exploited populations and strategies for minimizing fisheries-induced evolution. Responses to selective harvesting will depend on species-specific life-history traits, and on community-level and environmental processes. Therefore, the detection of fisheries-induced evolution and successful fish stock management requires routine population monitoring, and a good understanding of genetics, relevant ecological processes and changing environmental conditions.}

abstract = {Sharks, rays, and chimaeras (Class Chondrichthyes; herein 'sharks') are the earliest extant jawed vertebrates and exhibit some of the greatest functional diversity of all vertebrates. Ecologically, they influence energy transfer vertically through trophic levels and sometimes trophic cascades via direct consumption and predation risk. Through movements and migrations, they connect horizontally and temporally across habitats and ecosystems, integrating energy flows at large spatial scales and across time. This connectivity flows from ontogenetic growth in size and spatial movements, which in turn underpins their relatively low reproductive rates compared with other exploited ocean fishes. Sharks are also ecologically and demographically diverse and are taken in a wide variety of fisheries for multiple products (e.g. meat, fins, teeth, and gills). Consequently, a range of fisheries management measures are generally preferable to 'silver bullet' and 'one size fits all' conservation actions. Some species with extremely low annual reproductive output can easily become endangered and hence require strict protections to minimize mortality. Other, more prolific species can withstand fishing over the long term if catches are subject to effective catch limits throughout the species' range. We identify, based on the {IUCN} Red List status, 64 endangered species in particular need of new or stricter protections and 514 species in need of improvements to fisheries management. We designate priority countries for such actions, recognizing the widely differing fishing pressures and conservation capacity. We hope that this analysis assists efforts to ensure this group of ecologically important and evolutionarily distinct animals can support both ocean ecosystems and human activities in the future.

Recently, machine learning algorithms have been adopted to infer social associations from time-series data gathered using remote, telemetry systems situated at provisioning sites. We adapt and modify existing inference methods to reveal the underlying social structure of wide-ranging marine predators moving through spatial arrays of passive acoustic receivers. From six months of tracking data for grey reef sharks (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos) at Palmyra atoll in the Pacific Ocean, we demonstrate that some individuals emerge as leaders within the population and that this behavioural coordination is predicted by both sex and the duration of co-occurrences between conspecifics. In doing so, we provide the first evidence of long-term, spatially extensive social processes in wild sharks. To achieve these results, we interrogate simulated and real tracking data with the explicit purpose of drawing attention to the key considerations in the use and interpretation of inference methods and their impact on resultant social structure. We provide a modified translation of the {GMMEvents} method for R, including new analyses quantifying the directionality and duration of social events with the aim of encouraging the careful use of these methods more widely in less tractable social animal systems but where passive telemetry is already widespread. \copyright 2016 The Authors.}

abstract = {Movement data provide a window - often our only window - into the cognitive, social and biological processes that underlie the behavioural ecology of animals in the wild. Robust methods for identifying and interpreting distinct modes of movement behaviour are of great importance, but complicated by the fact that movement data are complex, multivariate and dependent. Many different approaches to exploratory analysis of movement have been developed to answer similar questions, and practitioners are often at a loss for how to choose an appropriate tool for a specific question. We apply and compare four methodological approaches: first passage time ({FPT}), Bayesian partitioning of Markov models ({BPMM}), behavioural change point analysis ({BCPA}) and a fitted multistate random walk ({MRW}) to three simulated tracks and two animal trajectories - a sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) tracked for 12 h and a wolf (Canis lupus) tracked for 1 year. The simulations - in which, respectively, velocity, tortuosity and spatial bias change - highlight the sensitivity of all methods to model misspecification. Methods that do not account for autocorrelation in the movement variables lead to spurious change points, while methods that do not account for spatial bias completely miss changes in orientation. When applied to the animal data, the methods broadly agree on the structure of the movement behaviours. Important discrepancies, however, reflect differences in the assumptions and nature of the outputs. Important trade-offs are between the strength of the a priori assumptions (low in {BCPA}, high in {MRW}), complexity of output (high in the {BCPA}, low in the {BPMM} and {MRW}) and explanatory potential (highest in the {MRW}). The animal track analysis suggests some general principles for the exploratory analysis of movement data, including ways to exploit the strengths of the various methods. We argue for close and detailed exploratory analysis of movement before fitting complex movement models. \copyright 2015 The Authors.

Low recapture rates are typical in many study systems including fishing-based studies. Incorporating auxiliary data into the models can improve precision and in some cases enable parameter estimation. Here, we present a novel application of acoustic telemetry for the estimation of apparent survival and abundance within capture-mark-recapture analysis using open population models. Our case study is based on simultaneously collecting longline fishing and acoustic telemetry data for a large mobile apex predator, the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorhynchus cepedianus), at a coastal site in Tasmania, Australia. Cormack-Jolly-Seber models showed that longline data alone had very low recapture rates while acoustic telemetry data for the same time period resulted in at least tenfold higher recapture rates. The apparent survival estimates were similar for the two datasets but the acoustic telemetry data showed much greater precision and enabled apparent survival parameter estimation for one dataset, which was inestimable using fishing data alone. Combined acoustic telemetry and longline data were incorporated into Jolly-Seber models using a Monte Carlo simulation approach. Abundance estimates were comparable to those with longline data only; however, the inclusion of acoustic telemetry data increased precision in the estimates. We conclude that acoustic telemetry is a useful tool for incorporating in capture-mark-recapture studies in the marine environment. Future studies should consider the application of acoustic telemetry within this framework when setting up the study design and sampling program.}

Extensive simulations are used to demonstrate the reasons that render order selection particularly challenging in practice despite the conceptual simplicity of the task. In particular, we demonstrate why well-established formal procedures for model selection, such as those based on standard information criteria, tend to favor models with numbers of states that are undesirably large in situations where states shall be meaningful entities. We also offer a pragmatic step-by-step approach together with comprehensive advice for how practitioners can implement order selection. Our proposed strategy is illustrated with a real-data case study on muskox movement.}

Potential disruption of vital cues by human activities must be understood in order to mitigate potential negative influences. Cable deployments in coastal waters are increasing worldwide, in capacity and number, owing to growing demands for electrical power and telecommunications. Increasingly, the local electromagnetic environment used by electro- and magneto-sensitive species will be altered. We quantified biologically relevant behavioural responses of the presumed, magneto-receptive American lobster and the electro-sensitive Little skate to electromagnetic field ({EMF}) emissions of a subsea high voltage direct current ({HVDC}) transmission cable for domestic electricity supply. We demonstrate a striking increase in exploratory/foraging behaviour in skates in response to {EMF} and a more subtle exploratory response in lobsters. In addition, by directly measuring both the magnetic and electric field components of the {EMF} emitted by {HVDC} cables we found that there were {DC} and unexpectedly {AC} components. Modelling, restricted to the {DC} component, showed good agreement with measured results. Our cross-disciplinary study highlights the need to integrate an understanding of the natural and anthropogenic {EMF} environment together with the responses of sensitive animals when planning future cable deployments and predicting their environmental effects.}

Owing to the inherent difficulty of empirical field studies, ecological state dynamics operating at any level of this hierarchy can often be unobservable or 'hidden'. Ecologists must therefore often contend with incomplete or indirect observations that are somehow related to these underlying processes. By formally disentangling state and observation processes based on simple yet powerful mathematical properties that can be used to describe many ecological phenomena, hidden Markov models ({HMMs}) can facilitate inferences about complex system state dynamics that might otherwise be intractable. However, {HMMs} have only recently begun to gain traction within the broader ecological community. We provide a gentle introduction to {HMMs}, establish some common terminology, review the immense scope of {HMMs} for applied ecological research and provide a tutorial on implementation and interpretation. By illustrating how practitioners can use a simple conceptual template to customise {HMMs} for their specific systems of interest, revealing methodological links between existing applications, and highlighting some practical considerations and limitations of these approaches, our goal is to help establish {HMMs} as a fundamental inferential tool for ecologists.

Laboratory studies suggest that spawning activity occurs primarily at night, yet no field studies have evaluated the influence of diel period on the behaviour of individual wild spawning cod. Using an acoustic telemetry positioning system, the fine-scale movements of spawning cod were observed in situ as they returned to the same spawning location over consecutive seasons. The resulting data identify clear gender-based diel patterns in space use and aggregation behaviour among cod on a spawning ground. During the day, females remained aggregated in one small location that varied little within and between years. Males also aggregated during the day, but occupied a much larger adjacent area. At night, individual males sought out separate small territories while females generally remained near their daytime aggregation site, making periodic excursions into the surrounding area. These patterns were surprisingly stable over the 2 years of observation, indicating little interannual variability in spawning behaviour. This study provides an unprecedented examination of the natural spawning behaviour of Atlantic cod, and makes connections between earlier laboratory studies and field observations.}

However, this information is lacking at a global scale. Here we show, using a big-data approach that combines satellite-tracked movements of pelagic sharks and global fishing fleets, that 24\% of the mean monthly space used by sharks falls under the footprint of pelagic longline fisheries. Space-use hotspots of commercially valuable sharks and of internationally protected species had the highest overlap with longlines (up to 76\% and 64\%, respectively), and were also associated with significant increases in fishing effort. We conclude that pelagic sharks have limited spatial refuge from current levels of fishing effort in marine areas beyond national jurisdictions (the high seas). Our results demonstrate an urgent need for conservation and management measures at high-seas hotspots of shark space use, and highlight the potential of simultaneous satellite surveillance of megafauna and fishers as a tool for near-real-time, dynamic management.}

Here we present a novel positioning method called {YAPS} (Yet Another Positioning Solver), involving Maximum Likelihood analysis of a state-space model applied directly to time of arrival ({TOA}) data in combination with a movement model. {YAPS} avoids the sequential positioning-filtering-approach applied in alternative tools by using all available data in a single model, and offers better accuracy and error control. Feasibility and performance of {YAPS} was rigorously tested in a simulation study and by applying {YAPS} to data from an acoustic transmitter towed in a receiver array. Performance was compared to an alternative positioning model and proprietary software. The simulation study and field test revealed that {YAPS} performance was better and more consistent than alternatives. We conclude that {YAPS} outperformed the compared alternative methods, and that {YAPS} constitute a vast improvement to currently available positioning software in acoustic telemetry. Additionally, in contrast to vendor-supplied solutions, {YAPS} is transparent, flexible and can easily be adapted and extended for further improvements or to meet study specific requirements such as three-dimensional positioning.}

abstract = {Offshore energy acquisition through the construction of wind farms is rapidly becoming one of the major sources of green energy all over the world. The construction of offshore wind farms contributes to the ocean soundscape as steel monopile foundations are commonly hammered into the seabed to anchor wind turbines. This pile driving activity causes repeated, impulsive, low-frequency sounds, reaching far into the environment, which may have an impact on the surrounding marine life. In this study, we investigated the effect of the construction of 50 wind turbine foundations, over a time span of four months, on the presence and movement behaviour of free-swimming, individually tagged Atlantic cod. The turbine foundations were constructed at a distance ranging between 2.3 and 7.1 km from the cod, which resided in a nearby, existing wind farm in the southern North Sea. Our results indicated that local fish remained in the exposed area during and in-between pile-driving activities, but showed some modest changes in movement patterns. The tagged cod did not increase their net movement activity, but moved closer to the scour-bed (i.e. hard substrate), surrounding their nearest turbine, during and after each piling event. Additionally, fish moved further away from the sound source, which was mainly due to the fact that they were positioned closer to a piling event before its start. We found no effect of the time since the last piling event. Long-term changes in movement behaviour can result in energy budget changes, and thereby in individual growth and maturation, eventually determining growth rate of populations. Consequently, although behavioural changes to pile driving in the current study seem modest, we believe that the potential for cumulative effects, and species-specific variation in impact, warrant more tagging studies in the future, with an emphasis on quantification of energy budgets.

abstract = {Acoustic telemetry is widely used to investigate aquatic animal movement. Pulse position modulation ({PPM}) is an acoustic telemetry method that allows multiple unique identification codes to be transmitted at a single acoustic frequency, typically in the 69 {kHz} range. However, because the potential number of unique identification codes (i.e. tags) is ultimately limited by the number of pulses in the {PPM} signal, this poses a practical limitation. In addition, different manufacturers have developed different approaches to encoding the transmitted data, hampering compatibility across brands. A lack of broad compatibility across telemetry systems restricts users to a single manufacturer and operating system, reduces market competition and limits innovation. As the aquatic animal tracking research community organises towards networks of devices and data, incompatibility becomes more problematic and jeopardizes the unique scientific benefits offered by the networking approach. Here, we make a plea for collaboration among the manufacturers globally and propose a set of open protocols to ensure equipment interoperability as a medium-term solution.}

Migration tracks were reconstructed for 42 eels tagged in Belgium and 12 in Germany. Additionally, some eels moved up north to exit the North Sea over the British Isles, confirming the existence of two different routes, even for eels exiting from a single river catchment. Furthermore, we observed a wide range in migration speeds (6.8-45.2 km day-1). We hypothesize that these are likely attributed to water currents, with eels migrating through the English Channel being significantly faster than eels migrating northward. \copyright 2022.

abstract = {Anthropogenic noise in the oceans is disturbing marine life. Among other groups, pelagic fish are likely to be affected by sound from human activities, but so far have received relatively little attention. Offshore wind farms have become numerous and will become even more abundant in the next decades. Wind farms can be interesting to pelagic fish due to food abundance or fisheries restrictions. At the same time, construction of wind farms involves high levels of anthropogenic noise, likely disturbing and/or deterring pelagic fish. Here, we investigated whether bottom-moored echosounders are a suitable tool for studying the effects of impulsive - intermittent, high-intensity - anthropogenic noise on pelagic fish around wind farms and we explored the possible nature of their responses. Three different wind farms along the Dutch and Belgian coast were examined, one with exposure to the passing by of an experimental seismic survey with a full-scale airgun array, one with pile driving activity in an adjacent wind farm construction site and one control site without exposure. Two bottom-moored echosounders were placed in each wind farm and recorded fish presence and behaviour before, during and after the exposures. The echosounders were successful in detecting variation in the number of fish schools and their behaviour. During the seismic survey exposure there were significantly fewer, but more cohesive, schools than before, whereas during pile driving fish swam shallower with more cohesive schools. However, the types and magnitudes of response patterns were also observed at the control site with no impulsive sound exposure. We therefore stress the need for thorough replication beyond single case studies, before we can conclude that impulsive sounds, from either seismic surveys or pile driving, are a disturbing factor for pelagic fish in otherwise attractive habitat around wind farms.

abstract = {Telemetry has major potential for application to fish habitat science and management, but to date it is underutilized in this regard. We posit this is because (1) fish telemetry projects are often geared towards detecting fish movement, opposed to systematically sampling habitat selection, and (2) there are often differences in scale between telemetry data and management decisions. We discuss various ways in which telemetry can contribute to fish habitat science and present some considerations for improving its application to this field. To date, most fish telemetry studies have been descriptive (e.g., fish use area A more than area B); greater adoption of more inferential study approaches that assess causal ecological drivers of movement and space use would be of value and require more extensive measurement of environmental conditions. We conclude by presenting a conceptual framework for scaling from individual studies to broad applications in habitat management. Established telemetry networks can readily support synthesis activities, although fish tracking data and environmental data are rarely stored together, and current disconnects among repositories may constrain broad integration and scalability.}

abstract = {The primary aim of this long-term angler-led tagging programme was to gain information about seasonal changes in distribution of the starry smooth-hound shark Mustelus asterias, along the Dutch coast for management and conservation purposes. Between 2011 and 2014, M. asterias comprised 92·6\% (n = 2418) of the total elasmobranch catch (n = 2612) by the licenced group of taggers within the Dutch Delta of which 2244 M. asterias were fin-tagged with plastic rototags. Sex and total length ({LT} ) composition inside the eastern tidal basin (Oosterschelde) were significantly different, i.e. more females and larger individuals, than outside indicating a pupping ground, which was confirmed by the capture of 30 newborn pups (≤32 cm). The distribution pattern of reported recaptured M. asterias (return-rate 3·6\%, n = 80) showed a circannual migration between summering in the southern North Sea and wintering in the English Channel and the Bay of Biscay, and suggests that M. asterias is philopatric. The Dutch angling season for M. asterias runs from approximately mid-May to mid-October when the water temperature is above 13° C. Recaptures of eight mature females, but no males in the Bay of Biscay, indicate partial spatial segregation by sex, where mature females migrate over larger distances than immature females and males. These observations, with the absence of recaptures in other known summering areas (i.e. the Irish Sea and Bristol Channel), suggest that the southern North Sea is used by a separate population. Implications for management and recommendations to improve and expand the study approach are discussed. \copyright 2016 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.}

These data were collated for four main gear types: beamtrawl, nephrops and otter trawls, and nets (including gillnets, tangle nets and trammel nets). Beamtrawlers caught proportionally more smaller individuals than otter trawlers, whilst nets were the most size-selective gear for larger sharks. Size-related discarding was observed, with smaller spurdog Squalus acanthias and starry smooth-hound Mustelus asterias (\textless  60 cm total length, {LT} ) usually being discarded. Such size-based selection was not evident for lesser-spotted dogfish Scyliorhinus canicula, which was generally landed as bait. Temporal changes in the discard-retention patterns were evident for S. acanthias and porbeagle Lamna nasus, with increased regulatory discarding as management measures became restrictive. A corresponding increase in the proportion of the non-quota M. asterias retained was also observed over the study period. Knowledge of the size-based discard-retention patterns by métier can also help inform on where future studies on discard survival could usefully be undertaken. \copyright 2019 Crown Copyright.

Quantifying the extent of sharks' decline, the risk of species extinction, and the consequences for marine ecosystems have been challenging and controversial, mostly due to data limitations. In this study, more than one century of multiple-sources of bibliographic records on presence and frequency of occurrence of three species of commercial sharks, the smooth-hounds Mustelus spp., in the Mediterranean Sea were compiled and analysed. Generalized additive models for location, scale and shape ({GAML\SS}) were used to estimate the rate of change of two of these species, Mustelus mustelus and Mustelus punctulatus, in four Mediterranean regions. Model results showed that smooth-hounds have declined by 80–90\% since the beginning of last century to almost disappear in a large part of their original distributional range during the 1980s and 1990s. Based on modelling results, a revision of the current International Union for Conservation of Nature classification of Mediterranean smooth-hounds would be advisable along with the application of urgent conservation measures.}

Multiple paternity ({MP}) has been identified in all species where more than 1 litter has been investigated; yet neither direct nor indirect benefits from {MP} have been determined in elasmobranchs. This has led to the suggestion that {MP} in this group may simply be a product of convenience polyandry with variation in the frequency of {MP} driven by differences in mate encounter rates. Here, we use molecular markers to investigate polyandry and {MP} in 2 closely related and commercially important species of shark, Mustelus antarcticus and Mustelus lenticulatus. In total, 328 M. antarcticus embryos originating from 29 different mothers and 75 M. lenticulatus embryos originating from 19 different mothers were genotyped using 8 microsatellite loci. We find that {MP} occurs in both species. However, in both species, the majority of litters were sired by a single father. Our results do not support increased fecundity per se as a driver of {MP}. Further, our results do not suggest that high population densities with resulting high mate encounter rates generated by breeding aggregations necessarily lead to high frequencies of {MP}. Importantly, we note evidence of reproductive skew within polyandrous litters, which is a predicted outcome of postcopulatory mechanisms.}

M. asterias is a widely distributed demersal shark, occupying the waters of the southern North Sea and Irish Sea in the north, to at least the southern Bay of Biscay in the south, and is seasonally abundant in {UK} waters. There are no species-specific management measures for the northeast Atlantic stock, and the complexity of its population structure is not yet fully understood. To address this issue, we deployed both mark-recapture and electronic tags on M. asterias to gain novel insights into its horizontal and vertical movements. Our data suggest that the habitat use of M. asterias changes on a seasonal basis, with associated changes in geographical distribution, depth utilisation and experienced temperature. We report the first direct evidence of philopatry for this species, and also provide initial evidence of sex-biased dispersal and potential metapopulation-like stock structuring either side of the {UK} continental shelf. Investigations of finer-scale vertical movements revealed clear diel variation in vertical activity. The illustrated patterns of seasonal space-use and behaviour will provide important information to support the stock assessment process and will help inform any future management options.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Pacific cod ( Gadus macrocephalus ) is an ecologically important species that supports a valuable commercial fishery throughout Alaska waters. Although its life history includes seasonal movement for spawning and feeding, little is known about its movement ecology. Here, we present results from the first study to use pop-up satellite archival tags ({PSATs}) to track the within-year movements of Pacific cod to understand their potential seasonal movement patterns within the Aleutian Islands. This study was part of a cooperative research project; tagging was conducted onboard commercial vessels during the winter fishing season while Pacific cod were aggregated to spawn in the central Aleutian Islands. {RESULTS}: Of the 36 {PSATs} deployed, we were able to obtain movement data from 13 Pacific cod that were at liberty between 60 and 360 days. We determined that three tagged Pacific cod were predated on by marine mammals and three were recaptured by the commercial fishery. Geolocation models were produced for four migrating individuals. Eight Pacific cod moved to a productive foraging ground near Seguam Island located 64 to 344 km from their release site and presumed spawning ground within a few weeks of their release. These movements indicate that some Pacific cod in the Aleutian Islands undergo seasonal migration. Three Pacific cod remained near their release locations (within 50 km) for more than 75 days suggesting the existence of partial migration in the population. Two Pacific cod undertook larger movements (378 and 394 km) during which they swam over deep passes and crossed several management boundaries highlighting the potential connectedness of Pacific cod throughout the Aleutian Islands. {CONCLUSIONS}: This study provided important initial insights into the seasonal movement patterns of Pacific cod in the Aleutian Islands. Most tracked Pacific cod (77\%) undertook migrations in the middle of March (64–394 km) from their winter spawning areas to summer foraging areas, but a few individuals remained in their capture location suggesting a partial migration strategy. Their ability to cross deep passes that were previously seen as potential barriers to movement has expanded our understanding of population connectivity.}

These data promise new forms of knowledge and insight into movement of humans, animals, and goods, and hence can increase our understanding of complex spatiotemporal processes such as disease outbreak, urban mobility, migration, and human‐species interaction.

abstract = {A wide array of technologies are available for gaining insight into the movement of wild aquatic animals. Although acoustic telemetry can lack the fine-scale spatial resolution of some satellite tracking technologies, the substantially longer battery life can yield important long-term data on individual behavior and movement for low per-unit cost. Typically, however, receiver arrays are designed to maximize spatial coverage at the cost of positional accuracy leading to potentially longer detection gaps as individuals move out of range between monitored locations. This is particularly true when these technologies are deployed to monitor species in hard-to-access locations.Here, we develop a novel approach to analyzing acoustic telemetry data, using the timing and duration of gaps between animal detections to infer different behaviors. Using the durations between detections at the same and different receiver locations (i.e., detection gaps), we classify behaviors into "restricted" or potential wider "out-of-range" movements synonymous with longer distance dispersal. We apply this method to investigate spatial and temporal segregation of inferred movement patterns in two sympatric species of reef shark within a large, remote, marine protected area ({MPA}). Response variables were generated using network analysis, and drivers of these movements were identified using generalized linear mixed models and multimodel inference.Species, diel period, and season were significant predictors of "out-of-range" movements. Silvertip sharks were overall more likely to undertake "out-of-range" movements, compared with gray reef sharks, indicating spatial segregation, and corroborating previous stable isotope work between these two species. High individual variability in "out-of-range" movements in both species was also identified.We present a novel gap analysis of telemetry data to help infer differential movement and space use patterns where acoustic coverage is imperfect and other tracking methods are impractical at scale. In remote locations, inference may be the best available tool and this approach shows that acoustic telemetry gap analysis can be used for comparative studies in fish ecology, or combined with other research techniques to better understand functional mechanisms driving behavior. \copyright 2021 The Authors.

abstract = {Abstract Due to the efficient propagation of sound in water, sound in the deep ocean propagates such great distances that soundscapes are influenced not only by local conditions but also by distant sound sources. Ocean Sound is now an Essential Ocean Variable within the Global Ocean Observing System making passive acoustic monitoring routine. Active acoustic probing of the environment informs us about ocean topography, currents and temperature, and abundance and type of marine life vital to fisheries and biodiversity related interests.Efficient sound propagation is the foundation of a proposed multipurpose acoustic network. Judiciously placed low-frequency acoustic sources transmitting to globally distributed passive acoustic systems provide: (1) high temporal resolution measurements of large-scale ocean temperature/heat content variability using tomography; and (2) underwater geo-positioning ({UW}-{GPS}) and communication services enabling basin-scale underwater operation of floats, gliders, and {AUVs}. Every platform (fixed or moving) equipped with a hydrophone becomes a {\textquotedblleftGPS\textquotedblright} receiver, while listening to the ocean soundscape. The combined active and passive acoustic technology will lead to multi-disciplinary discovery and improved understanding of ocean ecosystem health and biodiversity, climate variability and change, marine hazards, and maritime safety. The same system will improve the operation of gliders, floats and {AUVs}.}

abstract = {Movement ecologists study animals\textquoteright movement to help understand their behaviours and interactions with each other and the environment. Data from {GPS} loggers are increasingly important for this. These data need to be processed, segmented and summarised for further visual and statistical analysis, often using predefined parameters. Usually, this process is separate from the subsequent visual and statistical analysis, making it difficult for these results to inform the data processing and to help set appropriate scale and thresholds parameters. This paper explores the use of highly interactive visual analytics techniques to close the gap between processing raw data and exploratory visual analysis. Working closely with animal movement ecologists, we produced requirements to enable data characteristics to be determined, initial research questions to be investigated, and the suitability of data for further analysis to be assessed. We design visual encodings and interactions to meet these requirements and provide software that implements them. We demonstrate these techniques with indicative research questions for a number of bird species, provide software, and discuss wider implications for animal movement ecology.}

abstract = {Knowledge of the three-dimensional movement patterns of elasmobranchs is vital to understand their ecological roles and exposure to anthropogenic pressures. To date, comparative studies among species at global scales have mostly focused on horizontal movements. Our study addresses the knowledge gap of vertical movements by compiling the first global synthesis of vertical habitat use by elasmobranchs from data obtained by deployment of 989 biotelemetry tags on 38 elasmobranch species. Elasmobranchs displayed high intra- and interspecific variability in vertical movement patterns. Substantial vertical overlap was observed for many epipelagic elasmobranchs, indicating an increased likelihood to display spatial overlap, biologically interact, and share similar risk to anthropogenic threats that vary on a vertical gradient. We highlight the critical next steps toward incorporating vertical movement into global management and monitoring strategies for elasmobranchs, emphasizing the need to address geographic and taxonomic biases in deployments and to concurrently consider both horizontal and vertical movements.}

abstract = {Acoustic telemetry is a commonly applied method to investigate the ecology of marine animals and provides a scientific basis for management and conservation. Crucial insight in animal behaviour and ecosystem functioning and dynamics is gained through acoustic receiver networks that are established in many different environments around the globe. The main limitation to this technique is the ability of the receivers to detect the signals from tagged animals present in the nearby area. To interpret acoustic data correctly, understanding influencing factors on the detection probability is critical. Therefore, range test studies are an essential part of acoustic telemetry research. Here, we investigated whether specific environmental factors (i.e. wind, currents, waves, background noise, receiver tilt and azimuth) influence the receiver detection probability for a permanent acoustic receiver network in Belgium. Noise and wind speed in relation to distance, the interaction of receiver tilt and azimuth and current speed were the most influential variables affecting the detection probability in this environment. The study indicated that there is high detection probability up to a distance of circa 200 m. A new setup, making use of features that render valuable information for data analysis and interpretation, was tested and revealed general applicability.}

In total, 504 specimens [238 males, 24-99 cm total length ({LT}) and 266 females, 28-124 cm {LT}] were examined, with further information collected from 238 uterine pups. The lengths at 50\% maturity were estimated as 70·4 and 81·9 cm {LT} for males and females, respectively. Ovarian fecundity ranged from one to 28, and uterine fecundity from four to 20. The number, mass and {LT} of pups were positively correlated with maternal {LT}. Full-term pups ranged from 205 to 329 mm {LT}, and the smallest free-living fish caught was 24 cm {LT} . Parturition occurred in February in the western English Channel and during June to July in the eastern English Channel and southern North Sea, indicating either protracted spawning or asynchronous parturition for the stock as a whole. The reproductive cycle is thought to extend beyond 1 year. Developmental abnormalities observed included atresia in oocytes, uterine eggs that failed to develop, a partly developed pup and an abnormal male with a single aberrant clasper. Data relating to conversion factors, oocyte numbers and diameter and gonado-somatic and hepato-somatic indices are presented, and the seasonality of the reproductive cycle is discussed. \copyright 2015 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.}

abstract = {The stomach contents of 640 starry smooth-hound Mustelus asterias from the north-east Atlantic were examined. The diet was dominated by crustaceans (98.8\% percentage of index of relative importance, \%{IRI}), with the two main prey species being hermit crab Pagurus bernhardus (34\% {IRI}) and flying crab Liocarcinus holsatus (15\% {IRI}). Ontogenetic dietary preferences showed that smaller individuals [20-69 cm total length ({LT} ) n = 283] had a significantly lower diversity of prey than larger individuals (70-124 cm {LT} , n = 348); however, 18 prey species were found exclusively in smaller individuals and eight prey taxa were found exclusively in larger individuals. Larger commercially important brachyurans such as edible crab Cancer pagurus and velvet swimming crab Necora puber were more prevalent in the diet of larger individuals. Specimens from the North Sea ecoregion had a lower diversity of prey types for a given sample size than fish from the Celtic Seas ecoregion. Whilst cumulative prey curves did not reach an asymptote, this was primarily due to the high taxonomic resolution utilized and 95\% of the diet was described by just seven crustacean taxa. The trophic level ({TL}) was calculated as 4.34 when species-level prey categories were used. This fine-scale taxonomic resolution resulted in a {TL} estimate close to a whole level above that estimated using wider taxonomic groupings. This large bias has important methodological implications for {TL} studies based on categorized prey data, particularly those of predatory fish. \copyright 2019 Crown copyright.

A total of 57 studies were identified that contained relevant details on surgical methodological procedures. Of these, the majority of studies (43, or 75.4\%) employed tonic immobility, while 10 (17.6\%) used general chemical anaesthetic and 4 (7\%) used local chemical anaesthetic.

We used acoustic telemetry tracking and high-resolution water temperature data over a relatively large spatial scale (5.5 km2) to identify and quantify a thermal threshold for mass emigration of juvenile white sharks. Sixteen tagged sharks were observed to initiate a search for warmer water within 10-12 hours of an upwelling event where water temperatures dropped below 14 °C. Eleven sharks traveled \~ 35 km away where they experienced similar cold temperatures before returning to the aggregation site within 24 hours. Five days following the upwelling event, most sharks emigrated from the site for the season. Quantifying movement patterns across different spatial and temporal scales is necessary to understand cues and thresholds influencing animal migration, which may be greatly affected by climate anomalies and climate change, resulting in potential impacts on the dynamics of local prey species, management, and conservation policy and practice. \copyright 2022.

abstract = {Telemetry is an increasingly common tool for studying the ecology of wild fish, with great potential to provide valuable information for management and conservation. For researchers to conduct a robust telemetry study, many essential considerations exist related to selecting the appropriate tag type, fish capture and tagging methods, tracking protocol, data processing and analyses, and interpretation of findings. For telemetry-derived knowledge to be relevant to managers and policy makers, the research approach must consider management information needs for decision-making, while end users require an understanding of telemetry technology (capabilities and limitations), its application to fisheries research and monitoring (study design), and proper interpretation of results and conclusions (considering the potential for biases and proper recognition of associated uncertainties). To help bridge this gap, we provide a set of considerations and a checklist for researchers to guide them in conducting reliable and management-relevant telemetry studies, and for managers to evaluate the reliability and relevance of telemetry studies so as to better integrate findings into management plans. These considerations include implicit assumptions, technical limitations, ethical and biological realities, analytical merits, and the relevance of study findings to decision-making processes.}

Continental-scale acoustic telemetry networks are increasingly being established worldwide, producing large volumes of information-rich geospatial data. During the last decade, the Integrated Marine Observing System's Animal Tracking Facility ({IMOS} {ATF}) established a permanent array of acoustic receivers around Australia. Simultaneously, {IMOS} developed a centralised national database to foster collaborative research across the user community and quantify individual behaviour across a broad range of taxa. Here we present the database and quality control procedures developed to collate 49.6 million valid detections from 1891 receiving stations. This dataset consists of detections for 3,777 tags deployed on 117 marine species, with distances travelled ranging from a few to thousands of kilometres. Connectivity between regions was only made possible by the joint contribution of {IMOS} infrastructure and researcher-funded receivers. This dataset constitutes a valuable resource facilitating meta-analysis of animal movement, distributions, and habitat use, and is important for relating species distribution shifts with environmental covariates.}

We conducted an acoustic fine-scale tracking experiment from March to June 2017 to determine the common carp movement pattern and habitat use in the downstream area of the Pearl River. The eight tagged common carp were detected for 39.38 ± 29.57 d, on average, with a total average detection period of 42.12 ± 28.02 d. A general linear mixed model suggested they were detected more during the night than during the day. Common carp preferred habitats near the sandbar and riparian shallow habitats, as revealed by their movement tracks and habitat selection indexes. The general additive mixed model ({GAMM}) analysis of their shortest distances to riverbanks and depth indicated that they migrated to shallower riparian habitat more frequently during the night than during the day. The continuous wavelet spectrum further confirmed the significant diel pattern of their vertical movement. Their habitat use was also influenced by the water temperature, water level, and river discharge, as suggested by the {GAMM}. Our results provide novel information on common carp spatiotemporal movement and habitat use patterns, and have important implications for its native population restoration and the invasive population control/exclusion.}

In the last ten years, a number of online facilities have been developed for the archiving, processing and sharing of telemetry data. These facilities offer secure storage, multi-user support and analysis tools and are a step along the way to improving data access, long-term data preservation and science communication.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Tracking individual animals using satellite telemetry has improved our understanding of animal movements considerably. Nonetheless, thorough statistical treatment of Argos datasets is often jeopardized by their coarse temporal resolution. State-space modelling can circumvent some of the inherent limitations of Argos datasets, such as the limited temporal resolution of locations and the lack of information pertaining to the behavioural state of the tracked individuals at each location. We coupled state-space modelling with environmental characterisation of modelled locations on a 3-year Argos dataset of 9 breeding snowy owls to assess whether searching behaviour for breeding sites was affected by snow cover and depth in an arctic predator that shows a lack of breeding site fidelity. {RESULTS}: The state-space modelling approach allowed the discrimination of two behavioural states (searching and moving) during pre-breeding movements. Tracked snowy owls constantly switched from moving to searching behaviour during pre-breeding movements from mid-March to early June. Searching events were more likely where snow cover and depth was low. This suggests that snowy owls adapt their searching effort to environmental conditions encountered along their path. {CONCLUSIONS}: This modelling technique increases our understanding of movement ecology and behavioural decisions of individual animals both locally and globally according to environmental variables.}

abstract = {The behaviour and spatial use patterns of juvenile manta rays within their critical nursery habitats remain largely undocumented. Here, we report on the horizontal movements and residency of juvenile reef manta rays ( Mobula alfredi ) at a recently discovered nursery site in the Wayag lagoon, Raja Ampat, Indonesia. Using a multi-disciplinary approach, we provide further corroborative evidence that the lagoon serves as an important M. alfredi nursery. A total of 34 juvenile rays were photo-identified from 47 sightings in the sheltered nursery between 2013–2021. Five (14.7\%) of these individuals were resighted for at least 486 days (\~1.3 years), including two juveniles resighted after 641 and 649 days (\~1.7 years), still using the nursery. Visually estimated (n=34) disc widths ({DW}) of juveniles using the nursery site ranged from 150–240 cm (mean ± {SD}: 199 ± 19), and the {DW} of two juveniles measured using drones were 218 and 219 cm. Five juveniles were tracked using {GPS}-enabled satellite transmitters for 12–69 days (mean ± {SD}: 37 ± 22) in 2015 and 2017, and nine juveniles were tracked using passive acoustic transmitters for 69–439 days (mean ± {SD}: 182 ± 109) from May 2019–September 2021. Satellite-tracked individuals exhibited restricted movements within Wayag lagoon. The minimum core activity space (50\% Utilisation Distribution-{UD}) estimated for these five individuals ranged from 1.1–181.8 km 2 and the extent of activity space (95\% {UD}) between 5.3–1,195.4 km 2 in area. All acoustically tagged individuals displayed high residency within the nursery area, with no acoustic detections recorded outside the lagoon in the broader Raja Ampat region. These juveniles were detected by receivers in the lagoon throughout the 24 h diel cycle, with more detections recorded at night and different patterns of spatial use of the lagoon between day and night. The observed long-term residency of juvenile M. alfredi provides further compelling evidence that the Wayag lagoon is an important nursery area for this globally vulnerable species. These important findings have been used to underpin the formulation of management strategies to specifically protect the Wayag lagoon, which will be instrumental for the survival and recovery of M. alfredi populations in Raja Ampat region.}

A large variety of analysis methods are being developed, many of which in effect are inaccessible to potential users, because they remain unpublished, depend on proprietary software or require significant coding skills. {RESULTS}: We developed {MoveApps}, an open analysis platform for animal tracking data, to make sophisticated analytical tools accessible to a global community of movement ecologists and wildlife managers. As part of the Movebank ecosystem, {MoveApps} allows users to design and share workflows composed of analysis modules (Apps) that access and analyse tracking data. Users browse Apps, build workflows, customise parameters, execute analyses and access results through an intuitive web-based interface. Apps, coded in R or other programming languages, have been developed by the {MoveApps} team and can be contributed by anyone developing analysis code. They become available to all user of the platform. To allow long-term and cross-system reproducibility, Apps have public source code and are compiled and run in Docker containers that form the basis of a serverless cloud computing system. To support reproducible science and help contributors document and benefit from their efforts, workflows of Apps can be shared, published and archived with {DOIs} in the Movebank Data Repository. The platform was beta launched in spring 2021 and currently contains 44 Apps that are used by 156 registered users. We illustrate its use through two workflows that (1) provide a daily report on active tag deployments and (2) segment and map migratory movements. {CONCLUSIONS}: The {MoveApps} platform is meant to empower the community to supply, exchange and use analysis code in an intuitive environment that allows fast and traceable results and feedback. By bringing together analytical experts developing movement analysis methods and code with those in need of tools to explore, answer questions and inform decisions based on data they collect, we intend to increase the pace of knowledge generation and integration to match the huge growth rate in bio-logging data acquisition.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: In acoustic telemetry studies, detection range is usually evaluated as the relationship between the probability of detecting an individual transmission and the distance between the transmitter and receiver. When investigating animal presence, however, few detections will suffice to establish an animal\textquoterights presence within a certain time frame. In this study, we assess detection range and its impacting factors with a novel approach aimed towards studies making use of binary presence/absence metrics. The probability of determining presence of an acoustic transmitter within a certain time frame is calculated as the probability of detecting a set minimum number of transmissions within that time frame. We illustrate this method for hourly and daily time bins with an extensive empirical dataset of sentinel transmissions and detections in a receiver array in a Belgian offshore wind farm. {RESULTS}: The accuracy and specificity of over 84\% for both temporal resolutions showed the developed approach performs adequately. Using this approach, we found important differences in the predictive performance of distinct hypothetical range testing scenarios. Finally, our results demonstrated that the probability of determining presence over distance to a receiver did not solely depend on environmental and technical conditions, but would also relate to the temporal resolution of the analysis, the programmed transmitting interval and the movement behaviour of the tagged animal. The probability of determining presence differed distinctly from a single transmission\textquoterights detectability, with an increase of up to 266 m for the estimated distance at 50\% detection probability ( D50 ). {CONCLUSION}: When few detections of multiple transmissions suffice to ascertain presence within a time bin, predicted range differs distinctly from the probability of detecting a single transmission within that time bin. We recommend the use of more rigorous range testing methodologies for acoustic telemetry applications where the assessment of detection range is an integral part of the study design, the data analysis and the interpretation of results.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Movement pattern variations are reflective of behavioural switches, likely associated with different life history traits in response to the animals' abiotic and biotic environment. Detecting these can provide rich information on the underlying processes driving animal movement patterns. However, extracting these signals from movement time series, requires tools that objectively extract, describe and quantify these behaviours. The inference of behavioural modes from movement patterns has been mainly addressed through hidden Markov models. Until now, the metrics implemented in these models did not allow to characterize cyclic patterns directly from the raw time series. To address these challenges, we developed an approach to i) extract new metrics of cyclic behaviours and activity levels from a time-frequency analysis of movement time series, ii) implement the spectral signatures of these cyclic patterns and activity levels into a {HMM} framework to identify and classify latent behavioural states. {RESULTS}: To illustrate our approach, we applied it to 40 high-resolution European sea bass depth time series. Our results showed that the fish had different activity regimes, which were also associated (or not) with the spectral signature of different environmental cycles. Tidal rhythms were observed when animals tended to be less active and dived shallower. Conversely, animals exhibited a diurnal behaviour when more active and deeper in the water column. The different behaviours were well defined and occurred at similar periods throughout the annual cycle amongst individuals, suggesting these behaviours are likely related to seasonal functional behaviours (e.g. feeding, migrating and spawning). {CONCLUSIONS}: The innovative aspects of our method lie within the combined use of powerful, but generic, mathematical tools (spectral analysis and hidden Markov Models) to extract complex behaviours from 1-D movement time series. It is fully automated which makes it suitable for analyzing large datasets. {HMMs} also offer the flexibility to include any additional variable in the segmentation process (e.g. environmental features, location coordinates). Thus, our method could be widely applied in the bio-logging community and contribute to prime issues in movement ecology (e.g. habitat requirements and selection, site fidelity and dispersal) that are crucial to inform mitigation, management and conservation strategies.}

abstract = {When geolocating fish based on archival tag data, a realistic assessment of uncertainty is essential. Here, we describe an application of a novel Fokker–Planck-based method to geolocate Atlantic cod ( Gadus morhua ) in the North Sea area. In this study, the geolocation relies mainly on matching tidal patterns in depth measurements when a fish spends a prolonged period of time at the seabed with a tidal database. Each day, the method provides a nonparametric probability distribution of the position of a tagged fish and therefore avoids enforcing a particular distribution, such as a Gaussian distribution. In addition to the tidal component of the geolocation, the model incoporates two behavioural states, either high or low activity, estimated directly from the depth data, that affect the diffusivity parameter of the model and improves the precision and realism of the geolocation significantly. The new method provides access to the probability distribution of the position of the fish that in turn provides a range of useful descriptive statistics, such as the path of the most probable movement. We compare the method with existing alternatives and discuss its potential in making population inference from archival tag data.}

abstract = {Numerous methods have been developed to geolocate fish from data storage tags. Whereas demersal species have been tracked using tide-driven geolocation models, pelagic species which undertake extensive migrations have been mainly tracked using light-based models. Here, we present a new {HMM}-based model that infers pelagic fish positions from the sole use of high-resolution temperature and depth histories. A key contribution of our framework lies in model parameter inference (diffusion coefficient and noise parameters with respect to the reference geophysical fields\textemdashsatellite {\SST} and temperatures derived from the {MARS3D} hydrodynamic model), which improves model robustness. As a case study, we consider long time series of data storage tags ({DSTs}) deployed on European sea bass for which individual migration tracks are reconstructed for the first time. We performed a sensitivity analysis on synthetic and real data in order to assess the robustness of the reconstructed tracks with respect to model parameters, chosen reference geophysical fields and the knowledge of fish recapture position. Model assumptions and future directions are discussed. Finally, our model opens new avenues for the reconstruction and analysis of migratory patterns of many other pelagic species in relatively contrasted geophysical environments.}

Our open-source tool can be used to rapidly create formats including static articles, low-motion articles, interactive articles, slideshows, and videos. We evaluate our system through a series of real-world usage scenarios, showing how it benefits authors in the domains of data journalism, scientific publishing, and nonprofit advocacy. We show how Fidyll, provides expressive leverage by reducing the amount of non-narrative markup that authors need to write by 80-90\% compared to Idyll, an existing markup language for authoring interactive articles.}

Crabs were captured monthly from January 1998 to December 1999 in 18 sites located in three bays (Ubatumirim, Ubatuba, and Mar Virado), using a commercial fishing boat. In each sampling area, bottom temperature, salinity, and organic matter content were recorded. A total of 1,911 individuals were captured: 350 adult males, 475 non-ovigerous adult females, 584 adult ovigerous females, and 502 immature individuals. Reproductive females were more abundant in deeper areas; this migration might be a strategy to improve larval dispersion and survival. Ovigerous females were found year-round, indicating a continuous reproduction, and their abundance was positively correlated with temperature. During the 2-year survey, crabs with all gonadal development stages were found. We can infer that this region provides suitable resources for the development of A. spinimanus.}

We studied metazoan parasites of 20 immature sharks (13 males and seven females) from the English Channel and we examined their relationships with host condition and their use as host bioindicators. All the sharks were parasitized by one to six metazoan taxa among the twelve recorded in the whole sampling (one trematode, six cestodes and two nematodes trophically-transmitted; one monogenean, one copepod and one myxosporean on gills), with a mean abundance of 30.5 ± 21.4 parasites per fish (myxosporeans not included). The three major taxa were in decreasing order: the nematode Acanthocheilus rotundatus (prevalence: 75\%, Confidence Interval 53–89\%), the cestode Eutetrarhynchus sp. (70\%, {CI} 48–85\%), and the monogenean Erpocotyle laevis (60\%, {CI} 39–78\%). The gill copepod Kroyeria lineata and the gut nematode Proleptus obtusus were identified as significant pathogens. Parasite community differed between males and females despite their immature stage, suggesting early spatial sex-segregation, with E. laevis , Eutetrarhynchus sp. and Anthobothrium sp. proposed as tags. We discuss results in terms of host fitness loss and information given by parasites on diet ecology and stock discrimination. We recommend incorporating parasitology in further research to improve shark conservation and management.}

abstract = {Movement is a central feature of the ecology of fish, yet the study of fish movement has been inhibited due to its multidimensional nature and technological and analytical limitations. We used a relatively new fine-scale acoustic tracking system to quantify movements of an economically valuable, demersal marine fish species (gray triggerfish Balistes capriscus) on a natural hardbottom reef on the continental shelf of North Carolina, {USA}. Overall, 30 fish were tagged and released, and 104,170 highly precise (˜1–3 m) spatial positions were estimated during the 43-d study. To quantify gray triggerfish movements, we used a combination of exploratory data analyses and hidden Markov models ({HMM}), the latter of which can identify and elucidate normally hidden behavioral states. Both methods suggested gray triggerfish movements varied by diel period and among individuals, and that some of the variation among individuals could be explained by fish size. Depending on model specification, {HMMs} identified two or three behavioral states, one of which was likely resting that occurred mostly at night and another was likely foraging or transit that occurred mostly during the day. Moreover, resting at night occurred in small, discrete patches within the study area, whereas foraging or transit behaviors occurred broadly throughout the study area. We encourage a wider use of acoustic telemetry and {HMMs} to shed light on the normally hidden behaviors of demersal fishes.}

abstract = {Although whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) have been documented to move thousands of kilometres, they are most frequently observed at a few predictable seasonal aggregation sites. The absence of sharks at the surface during visual surveys has led to the assumption that sharks disperse to places unknown during the long 'off-seasons' at most of these locations. Here we compare 2 years of R. typus visual sighting records from Mafia Island in Tanzania to concurrent acoustic telemetry of tagged individuals. Sightings revealed a clear seasonal pattern with a peak between October and February and no sharks observed at other times. By contrast, acoustic telemetry demonstrated year-round residency of R. typus. The sharks use a different habitat in the off-season, swimming deeper and further away from shore, presumably in response to prey distributions. This behavioural change reduces the sharks' visibility, giving the false impression that they have left the area. We demonstrate, for the first time to our knowledge, year-round residency of unprovisioned, individual R. typus at an aggregation site, and highlight the importance of using multiple techniques to study the movement ecology of marine megafauna. \copyright 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Here we describe the use of three-dimensional ({3D}) kernel utilization distributions to estimate the volumetric space use of individuals based on tracking data and to estimate the overlap in activity space between individuals. Data from European eels ( Anguilla anguilla ) from Norwegian coastal waters were used to compare the information conveyed by {2D} and {3D} activity space estimates and the utility of this approach for aquatic species. The use of {3D} kernels produced detailed representations of space use in A. anguilla that permitted examination of depth use in a geographic context. Comparison of {2D} and {3D} home ranges showed that {2D} analyses overestimated the amount of overlap between individuals by 13\%–20\%, because individuals sometimes occurred in the same location but used different depths. Hence, the {3D} approach provided more comprehensive representations of animal movement in three dimensions while producing a metric that can be used for testing hypotheses relating to scientific descriptions of activity space, habitat use, and movement parameters.}

The present study assessed the potential influences of temperature and depth on aggregations and reproductive events of the narrownose smooth-hound shark (Mustelus schmitti), using an analysis criterion based on the co-occurrence of different reproductive stages. Data were collected from 363 sample sites during six research surveys, covering an area of \~47744km2 along the coast (38–42°S, depth of \textless50m). Aggregations of M. schmitti adults were mostly associated with the warmer spring surveys, with the aggregation sites being significantly warmer than those of non-aggregation. Evidence of pupping and ovulation was observed, almost simultaneously, during all spring surveys. However, the occurrence of these reproductive events showed a clear interannual variability pattern that was significantly explained by water temperature. Particularly, the occurrence of ovulation was associated with temperatures above 16–17°C. These results suggest that M. schmitti adults may follow the warming gradient along the environment and, thus, they aggregate in shallow and productive waters during the course of spring. Their reproductive events could be induced by temperature increase. This scenario suggests that changes in the patterns of bottom temperature may be important drivers of the reproductive dynamics of M. schmitti.}

This study describes the relationship between temperature fluctuations and the plasmatic changes of the sex steroids related to reproduction: testosterone (T), estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4), throughout the female reproductive cycle of the shark Mustelus schmitti. A total of 123 adult females were bi-monthly sampled in Buenos Aires, Argentina, coastal waters. Bottom temperatures were recorded at each sampling point and blood samples were taken from each female for plasma sex steroids measurement. Sex steroid plasma levels were analyzed in relation with maximum follicular diameter ({MFD}), uterosomatic index ({USI}, as indicator of pregnancy) and temperature using Generalized Additive Models. Plasmatic E2 and T increased during follicular growth until {MFD} reached 1.34 and 1.46 cm, respectively. Peak of T occurred at the follicular stage associated with parturition ({MFD}, 1.4-1.6 cm), just prior to final maturation and ovulation ({MFD}, 1.6-2.0 cm). Progesterone significantly increased at this last ovarian phase, while T and E2 decreased. The increase of {USI} with pregnancy was associated to a decrease in T and mainly E2 levels, while P4 remained unaffected. Prior to ovulation, T plasma levels decreased with temperature below to 13 °C and then increased progressively with a pronounced elevation above 17 °C, while E2 presented an opposite pattern. Progesterone plasma levels changed with temperature showing a similar pattern to that observed for T. Using M. schmitti shark as model species, this study shows a clear picture of how seawater temperature variations can affect the reproductive physiology in elasmobranch females. A hypothetical mechanism (based on T elevation driven by temperature increase and its connection by feedback with a P4 rise and parturition/ovulation induction) is proposed as evidence to support that the increase in temperature can trigger reproductive events in elasmobranchs. In addition to its ecological scope, this work contributes to reinforce the relatively scarce general knowledge of elasmobranchs reproductive physiology. Copyright \copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Groups of sharks have been observed for centuries, and understanding the mechanisms that facilitate their formation furthers our comprehension of the adaptive value of sociality. However, there is a dearth of quantitative analyses on these mechanisms. The preference for familiars can influence group formation and facilitate an increased level of fitness. This preference has been documented across many vertebrate classes, but has not been shown to have an overall effect on partner preference in chondrichthyan fishes. This deficiency is significant due to the taxa's ecological diversification and importance. In this study, we used behavioral experiments to assess the potential role of familiarity in group formation and on social behavior in a large marine vertebrate. Juvenile lemon sharks, Negaprion brevirostris, (N = 23) in Bimini, Bahamas, were separated into holding pens according to their size and given 14 days to familiarize with their cohort. Two pairs of sharks were selected from separate holding pens and introduced in a social network pen for a behavioral trial. {SNA} indicated that N. brevirostris showed a significant preference for familiar individuals, performing more social interactions, such as closely following, with individuals from their holding pen. We suggest that this preference for familiars is developed through repeated interactions and facilitates the advantages of maintaining stable behavioral interactions, which results in spatial isolation from unfamiliars. These findings advance our understanding of the mechanisms driving social structure in N. brevirostris and other large marine predators, which contribute to an animal's overall fitness and evolutionary adaptability.}

abstract = {Understanding animal movement decisions that involve migration is critical for evaluating population connectivity, and thus persistence. Recent work on sharks has shown that often only a portion of the adult population will undertake migrations, while the rest may be resident in an area for long periods. Defining the extent to which adult sharks use specific habitats and their migratory behaviour is essential for assessing their risk of exposure to threats such as fishing and habitat degradation. The present study used acoustic telemetry to examine residency patterns and migratory behaviour of adult bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) along the East coast of Australia. Fifty-six {VR2W} acoustic receivers were used to monitor the movements of 33 bull sharks in the central Great Barrier Reef ({GBR}). Both males and females were detected year-round, but their abundance and residency peaked between September and December across years (2012-2014). High individual variability in reef use patterns was apparent, with some individuals leaving the array for long periods, whereas others (36\%) exhibited medium (0.20-0.40) or high residency (\textgreater 0.50). A large portion of the population (51\%) undertook migrations of up to 1,400 km to other coral reefs and/or inshore coastal habitats in Queensland and New South Wales. Most of these individuals (76\%) were mature females, and the timing of migrations coincided with the austral summer (Dec-Feb). All migrating individuals (except one) returned to the central {GBR}, highlighting its importance as a potential foraging ground. Our findings suggest that adult bull sharks appear to be highly dependent on coral reef resources and provide evidence of partial migration, where only a portion of the female population undertook seasonal migrations potentially to give birth. Given that estuarine habitats face constant anthropogenic pressures, understanding partial migration and habitat connectivity of large coastal predators should be a priority for their management.}

We examined the residency and movements of silvertip sharks in the central Great Barrier Reef ({GBR}). An array of 56 {VR2W} acoustic receivers was used to monitor shark movements on 17 semi-isolated reefs. Twenty-seven individuals tagged with acoustic transmitters were monitored from 70 to 731 d. Residency index to the study site ranged from 0.05 to 0.97, with a mean residency (±{SD}) of 0.57 ± 0.26, but most individuals were detected at or near their tagging reef. Clear seasonal patterns were apparent, with fewer individuals detected between September and February. A large proportion of the tagged population (\textgreater71 \%) moved regularly between reefs. Silvertip sharks were detected less during daytime and exhibited a strong diel pattern in depth use, which may be a strategy for optimizing energetic budgets and foraging opportunities. This study provides the first detailed examination of the spatial ecology and behavior of silvertip sharks on coral reefs. Silvertip sharks remained resident at coral reef habitats over long periods, but our results also suggest this species may have more complex movement patterns and use larger areas of the {GBR} than common reef shark species. Our findings highlight the need to further understand the movement ecology of silvertip sharks at different spatial and temporal scales, which is critical for developing effective management approaches.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Understanding fish movements and migrations are paramount for management and conservation efforts. By applying Hidden Markov Models ({HMMs}) on records from electronic tags, migration routes of tagged fish can be reconstructed and new insights to the movement ecology of a species can be gained. We demonstrate the usability of {HMMs} on a widespread, iteroparous salmonid (sea trout, Salmo trutta ) in a complex marine area with highly variable temperatures and salinities within small geographic distances. Understanding how the highly adaptable sea trout cope with these complex conditions could shed new light on factors driving the movement ecology of salmonids. Migration tracks of fish migrating at sea are reconstructed by applying an {HMM} on temperature and depth records from eight wild post-spawned sea trout from four Danish rivers. {RESULTS}: The fish migrated at sea for 47–142 days. Estimated positions of all fish were close to the coast (\textless 100 km) throughout the marine period, but migrations along coastlines up to 580 km away from the natal river occurred. Seven of eight individuals resided in or actively migrated into stratified or shallow marine areas that heat up fast during spring, while all eight individuals resided in deeper and more heterogeneous areas that heat up slow during summer. All fish entered the Skagerrak (located between Denmark and Norway) at some stage during summer. Migrations were directed into less saline areas during the first 15 days at sea for all individuals. Mean linear progression of the fish was 16 km day −1 (range 0–58 km day −1 ). {CONCLUSIONS}: The results corroborate the expectation that sea trout are more coastally orientated than other salmonids, but also suggest that longer migrations occur in the seas surrounding Denmark compared to elsewhere. This could be a consequence of the fish seeking out habitats with optimal conditions (e.g. salinity, temperature, predation and foraging options) for growth in different parts of the year. The coinciding movement from shallow or stratified marine areas that heat up fast during spring to deeper, more well-mixed areas that heat up slow during summer suggested that some habitat selection had occurred. These results shed new light on factors influencing marine migrations in salmonids and demonstrate how {HMMs} can expand our knowledge on behaviour and movement ecology of marine fishes.}

abstract = {Juvenile rig (Mustelus lenticulatus) were internally tagged with acoustic transmitters and tracked with acoustic receivers deployed throughout two arms of Porirua Harbour, a small (7 km(2)) estuary in New Zealand. Ten rig were tracked for up to four months during summer-autumn to determine their spatial and temporal use of the habitat. The overall goal was to estimate the size of Marine Protected Areas required to protect rig nursery areas from direct human impacts. Rig showed clear site preferences, but those preferences varied among rig and over time. They spent most of their time in large basins and on shallow sand and mud flats around the margins, and avoided deep channels. Habitat range increased during autumn for many of the rig. Only one shark spent time in both harbour arms, indicating that there was little movement between the two. Rig home ranges were 2-7 km(2), suggesting that an effective {MPA} would need to cover the entire Porirua Harbour. They moved to outer harbour sites following some high river flow rates, and most left the harbour permanently during or soon after a river spike, suggesting that they were avoiding low salinity water. Rig showed strong diel movements during summer, although the diel pattern weakened in autumn. Persistent use of the same day and night sites indicates that diel movements are directed rather than random. Further research is required to determine the sizes of rig home ranges in larger harbours where nursery habitat is more extensive. Marine Protected Areas do not control land-based impacts such as accelerated sedimentation and heavy metal pollution, so integration of marine and terrestrial management tools across a range of government agencies is essential to fully protect nursery areas.}

abstract = {Shark nurseries are susceptible to environmental fluctuations in salinity because of their shallow, coastal nature; however, the physiological impacts on resident elasmobranchs are largely unknown. Gummy sharks (Mustelus antarcticus) and school sharks (Galeorhinus galeus) use the same Tasmanian estuary as a nursery ground; however, each species has distinct distribution patterns that are coincident with changes in local environmental conditions, such as increases in salinity. We hypothesized that these differences were directly related to differential physiological tolerances to high salinity. To test this hypothesis, we exposed wild, juvenile school and gummy sharks to an environmentally relevant hypersaline (120\% {SW}) event for 48 h. Metabolic rate decreased 20-35\% in both species, and gill Na(+)/K(+)-{ATPase} activity was maintained in gummy sharks but decreased 37\% in school sharks. We measured plasma ions (Na(+), K(+), Cl(-)) and osmolytes [urea and trimethylamine oxide ({TMAO})], and observed a 33\% increase in plasma Na(+) in gummy sharks with hyperosmotic exposure, while school sharks displayed a typical ureosmotic increase in plasma urea (∼20\%). With elevated salinity, gill {TMAO} concentration increased by 42\% in school sharks and by 30\% in gummy sharks. Indicators of cellular stress (heat shock proteins {HSP70}, 90 and 110, and ubiquitin) significantly increased in gill and white muscle in both a species- and a tissue-specific manner. Overall, gummy sharks exhibited greater osmotic perturbation and ionic dysregulation and a larger cellular stress response compared with school sharks. Our findings provide physiological correlates to the observed distribution and movement of these shark species in their critical nursery grounds. \copyright 2016.

This has made it into one of the most widely used methods nowadays. Many ways to analyse acoustic telemetry data have been made available and deciding on how to analyse the data requires considering the type of research objectives, relevant properties of the data (e.g., resolution, study design, equipment), habits of the study species, researcher experience, among others. To ease this decision process, here we showcase (1) some of the methods used to estimate pseudo-positions and positions from raw acoustic telemetry data, (2) methods to estimate residency and (3) methods to estimate two-dimensional home and occurrence range using geometric or hull-based methods and density-distribution methods, a network-based approach, and three-dimensional methods. We provide examples of some of these were tested using a sample of real data. With this we intend to provide the necessary background for the selection of the method(s) that better fit specific research objectives when using acoustic telemetry. \copyright 2023.

Using the recently developed cellular energy allocation ({CEA}) assay, energy reserves (protein, lipid and sugar) and energy consumption (as derived from the cellular respiration rate) were integrated into a general indicator of physiological stress. Total energy reserves were relatively unaffected by sampling season or location, whereas the individual energy reserve fractions of N. integer were differentially influenced by sampling location and season. Seasonal effects were apparent for mysid weight and were related to the population biology, whereas spatial effects on the weight of N. integer may depend on pollution-induced effects on cellular energy allocation in the two most upstream sites (Bath and Doel). These upstream sites coincide with the most polluted part of the sampled area and were characterized by a significant increase in energy consumption, resulting in a significantly lower {CEA}. Due to the recent amelioration in the oxygen concentration at these sites, it can be expected that N. integer will migrate further upstream, similar to what is observed in other European estuaries. It will, therefore, be important to assess the physiological consequences and potential population effects on mysids from these polluted areas in the Scheldt estuary. This study provides evidence that the {CEA} assay has potential under field conditions as an in situ biomarker of pollutant effects.}

Mustelus lunulatus fed in large proportion on Stomatopoda and Brachyura, whereas M. henlei fed almost exclusively on Teleostei. Dendrobranchiata, Cephalopoda, Anomura and Polychaeta complemented the diets of both species. There were significant differences in diet between the two species, and there was an ontogenetic diet shift in Mustelus lunulatus, with Stomatopoda being the main prey item of juveniles and Brachyura the main prey item of adults. Dietary overlap (by sex and size) was low between species, but it was high for each species, with significant overlap between juveniles and adults of M. lunulatus and M. henlei, and between males and females of M. henlei. There were differences in the trophic levels of the species, sexes and sizes. This study suggests there is food resource partitioning, and differing ecological function of the two Mustelus species in the food web of the study area.}

Understanding their limitations and interactions with environmental dynamics is crucial for a more comprehensive management. Utilizing spring-summer gillnet fishery data from the Rio de la Plata estuarine region, we addressed the influence of environmental drivers on Mustelus schmitti shark yield (individuals per 100 m net and 24 h soak time). In particular, we applied a two-stage boosted regression tree (Delta-{BRT}) approach to investigate relationships between environmental predictors and both smoothhound presence and relative yield. Results suggested that M. schmitti presence was most influenced by distance to coast, latitude and temperature, and the relative yield by distance to coast, month and wind. Fishery success was more likely to occur at long distances from the shore, southernmost locations, during early spring when temperature remains cool, and under environmental factors favouring the occurrence of the salinity front (28–30 range) over the fishing ground. Interannual differences in M. schmitti distribution were mainly explained by changes in salinity conditions driven by extreme anomalies in freshwater discharge. This study provides insight into considering environmental importance on resources availability for a more effective management of small-scale fisheries settled along environmental boundaries.}

Twenty-four sharks were equipped with acoustic tags and logged by an array of 28 acoustic receivers from November 2006 to November 2008. Generalised additive and generalised additive mixed models ({GAMMs}) were used to explain patterns of movement in terms of the environmental conditions related to temperature, the rate of change of temperature, tidal flow, diel cycle and moon phase. The most important environmental parameters affecting movement and direction of movement were related to absolute temperature and changes in temperature at the position of the shark. The movement of M. mustelus was not affected by tide and only minimally affected by the diel cycle, suggesting behavioural thermoregulation as the ultimate cause of the movements. M. mustelus preferred temperatures from 18 to 22°C, as determined by {GAMMs} for environmental conditions experienced in summer. The combination of the thermal environment, rich feeding grounds and protective effect of the Langebaan Marine Protected Area may explain the high abundance and regular occurrence of M. mustelus within this marine protected area.}

The satellite tags provided depth and temperature data for a cumulative 4489 days (mean 140 ± 97 days per shark, range 10–292 days) to describe vertical space use and thermal range of basking sharks in the north-east Atlantic. Basking sharks exhibit seasonality in vertical space use, revealing repeated \textquoteleftyo-yo\textquoteright movement behaviour with periods of occupancy at depths greater than 1000 m in late winter/early spring.

A hidden Markov model ({HMM}) geolocation method previously developed for other groundfish species was adapted to estimate the movement tracks of the tagged halibut (n = 25) based on the tag-recorded depth and temperature. Total distance travelled based on geolocation ranged from 36 to 1701 km, whereas straight line distance between tagging and end locations ranged from 0.4 to 440.7 km. Estimated movement rates varied between 2.7 and 10 km day−1. Two tagged halibut made long-distance movements to putative spawning habitat in the Northeast Channel off Georges Bank. Thirteen (13) out of 25 geolocated individuals were estimated to have reached Canadian waters. Geolocation results revealed home range, return movement, and seasonal migration movement patterns exhibited by the tagged halibut. The {HMM} geolocation method could be a useful tool in providing information on halibut movements that can inform stock assessment and management decisions.}

Statistical analysis of movement data is complicated by the fact that the data are multidimensional, autocorrelated and often marked by error and irregular measurement intervals or gappiness. Furthermore, movement data reflect behaviours that are themselves heterogeneous. Here, we model movement data as a subsampling of a continuous stochastic processes, and introduce the behavioural change point analysis ({BCPA}), a likelihood-based method that allows for the identification of significant structural changes. The {BCPA} is robust to gappiness and measurement error, computationally efficient, easy to implement and reveals structure that is otherwise difficult to discern. We apply the analysis to a {GPS} movement track of a northern fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus), revealing an unexpectedly complex diurnal behavioural profile, and demonstrate its robustness to the greater errors associated with the {ARGOS} tracking system. By informing empirical interpretation of movement data, we suggest that the {BCPA} can eventually motivate the development of mechanistic behavioural models.}

Since relative density ratios are always smoother than corresponding ordinary density ratios, our proposed method is favorable in terms of nonparametric convergence speed. Furthermore, we show that the proposed divergence estimator has asymptotic variance independent of the model complexity under a parametric setup, implying that the proposed estimator hardly overfits even with complex models. Through experiments, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach.}

abstract = {Increased availability of high-resolution movement data has led to the development of numerous methods for studying changes in animal movement behavior. Path segmentation methods provide basics for detecting movement changes and the behavioral mechanisms driving them. However, available path segmentation methods differ vastly with respect to underlying statistical assumptions and output produced. Consequently, it is currently difficult for researchers new to path segmentation to gain an overview of the different methods, and choose one that is appropriate for their data and research questions. Here, we provide an overview of different methods for segmenting movement paths according to potential changes in underlying behavior. To structure our overview, we outline three broad types of research questions that are commonly addressed through path segmentation: 1) the quantitative description of movement patterns, 2) the detection of significant change-points, and 3) the identification of underlying processes or 'hidden states'. We discuss advantages and limitations of different approaches for addressing these research questions using path-level movement data, and present general guidelines for choosing methods based on data characteristics and questions. Our overview illustrates the large diversity of available path segmentation approaches, highlights the need for studies that compare the utility of different methods, and identifies opportunities for future developments in path-level data analysis.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Migratory species face numerous threats related to human encroachment and climate change. Several migratory populations are declining and individuals are losing their migratory behaviour. To understand how habitat loss or changes in the phenology of natural processes affect migrations, it is crucial to clearly identify the timing and the patterns of migration. We propose an objective method, based on the detection of changes in movement patterns, to identify departure and arrival dates of the migration. We tested the efficiency of our approach using simulated paths before applying it to spring migration of migratory caribou from the Rivière-George and Rivière-aux-Feuilles herds in northern Québec and Labrador. We applied the First-Passage Time analysis ({FPT}) to locations of 402 females collected between 1986 and 2012 to characterize their movements throughout the year. We then applied a signal segmentation process in order to segment the path of {FPT} values into homogeneous bouts to discriminate migration from seasonal range use. This segmentation process was used to detect the winter break and the calving ground use because spring migration is defined by the departure from the winter range and the arrival on the calving ground. {RESULTS}: Segmentation of the simulated paths was successful in 96\% of the cases, and had a high precision (96.4\% of the locations assigned to the appropriate segment). Among the 813 winter breaks and 669 calving ground use expected to be detected on the {FPT} profiles, and assuming that individuals always reduced movements for each of the two periods, we detected 100\% of the expected winter breaks and 89\% of the expected calving ground use, and identified 648 complete spring migrations. Failures to segment winter breaks or calving ground use were related to individuals only slowing down or performing less pronounced pauses resulting in low mean {FPT}. {CONCLUSION}: We show that our approach, which relies only on the analysis of movement patterns, provides a suitable and easy-to-use tool to study species exhibiting variations in their migration patterns and seasonal range use.}

The project has brought together a European consortium of specialists in benthic ecology and seabed habitat mapping. The partners first collaborated in {EMODnet} phase 1 (2009-2012) to deliver a prototype predictive seabed habitat map in four trial basins (Greater North Sea, Celtic Seas, Baltic, Western Mediterranean). This predictive model was named {EUSeaMap} (Cameron and Askew, 2011). In {EMODnet} Phase 2 (2012-2016), the consortium extended {EUSeaMap} coverage to all European regions (Populus et al, 2017). In phase 3 (2017-2021), a first version (2019) extended the spatial coverage further North in order to include the Barents Sea, developed better environmental data were incorporated, and dramatically improved the spatial detail. The new version, developed in the period 2019-2021 and named 2021, is substantially evolved from the previous version as it accounts for new seabed substrate data published by {EMODnet} Geology in 2021, including in Denmark, Estonia, France, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Norway and Spain, 2) is published in new classifications, including the new version of the marine section of {EUNIS}, named {EUNIS} 2019 and 3) addresses some issues identified in {EUSeaMap} 2019.}

The emphasis is on the processes that are responsible for the physical environment. The dominant feature is the tidal motion. This is not only a mechanism for vertical and horizontal mixing. The tidal residuals also contribute to a basic circulation pattern that together with the long-term net effects of the wind-driven circulation and the baroclinic effects results in an overall transport that determines the major features of the distribution of the water properties. Superimposed on this there are variations (mainly wind-induced) and regional differences in a wide range of time- and length-scales. Some typical features of both the southern and northern part of the North Sea are discussed. The review is concluded with a discussion on the long-term variations in the physical conditions of the North Sea. These are mainly to changes in temperature, salinity and sea-level.}

The reason why the number of cable faults increased rapidly in the period 1970–1977 could be correlated with the changes in the shape of trawl shoes and their weight as a result of a rapid increase of the average horse power of the beamtrawls in the same period.}

Eastern English Channel fish assemblages: measuring the structuring effect of habitats on distinct sub-communities – {ICES} Journal of Marine Science, 64: 271–287. Multivariate and spatial analyses are used to identify and locate fish, cephalopod, and macrocrustacean species assemblages in the eastern English Channel from 1988 to 2004. Four sub-communities with varying diversity levels were identified in relation to depth, salinity, temperature, seabed shear stress, sediment type, and benthic community nature. From 1997 to 2004, some 25\% of overall community structure variance could be related to the available environmental descriptors and 20\% to persistent factors such as depth, seabed shear stress, sediment, and macro-invertebrate community type. Although there may be significant interannual shifts in overall community structure and composition, the sub-communities identified persisted over time, reflecting the relative stability of the environmental conditions in this area. The diversity levels of the community appeared to have increased over the past 2 decades and to be higher in areas with soft sediments and wide temperature and salinity variations, typically coastal river plumes and estuaries where bentho-demersal species dominated. The strong spatial structure of the fish communities in the eastern English Channel reflects the different types of habitats shared by differing species assemblages. Such persistence may be useful for spatially explicit planning of human use and resource management.}

Within the Channel there are considerable variations in temperature and other hydrographic conditions, and these are discussed in relation to their possible role as limiting factors in distribution. The fauna and bottom deposits of the different areas covered in the survey are briefly described. Distribution trends are classified as: (1) Species generally distributed in the Channel. This is the largest group, and includes three species reaching their northern limits in British waters. (2) Species confined to the western parts of the Channel. (a) Western species . Four or five species common at Plymouth in the 1920's, but now absent or very rare. Small numbers are found today only off the south Cornish coast, and those which occur in the North Sea are restricted to the north-western areas. Apart from one species, these forms are not at their geographical limits in the English Channel, and their occurrence may be partly related to the presence of western, but not necessarily Sagitta elegans , water. (b) Cornubian species . These are near the northern end of their range, and occur quite commonly off the south Cornish coast, becoming progressively less common farther up-Channel. It is suggested that their distribution is related to an intolerance of the lower winter temperatures in the more eastern part of the Channel.}

abstract = {Pelagic sharks are vulnerable to overfishing because of their low reproductive rates, generally low growth rates, and high catch rates in tuna and billfish fisheries worldwide. Pelagic sharks often migrate long distances, but they may also occur close to shore, making it difficult to classify their behaviour on the continuum from oceanic nomad to coastal resident. This has important implications for fishery management, which must be targeted at an appropriate spatial scale. Conventional tagging indicates that shortfin mako sharks move widely around the southwest Pacific Ocean, but there is little information on their habitat use or mobility in the region. This study deployed electronic tags on 14 mostly juvenile New Zealand mako sharks to investigate their habitat use, and the spatial and temporal scale of their movements. Movement behaviour was classified as Resident or Travel, with the former focused in New Zealand coastal waters, and the latter in oceanic waters around New Zealand and along oceanic ridges running north towards the tropical islands of Fiji, Vanuatu and New Caledonia. Sharks regularly switched between Resident and Travel behavioural states, but their residency periods sometimes lasted for several months. Sharks spent most of their time in the New Zealand Exclusive Economic Zone (median 77\%, five sharks \textgreater 90\%), presumably because of the high coastal productivity and access to abundant prey. These results challenge the conventional view that mako sharks are nomadic wanderers, and suggest that fishing mortality should be managed at a local as well as a regional scale.}

abstract = {It is a golden age for animal movement studies and so an opportune time to assess priorities for future work. We assembled 40 experts to identify key questions in this field, focussing on marine megafauna, which include a broad range of birds, mammals, reptiles, and fish. Research on these taxa has both underpinned many of the recent technical developments and led to fundamental discoveries in the field. We show that the questions have broad applicability to other taxa, including terrestrial animals, flying insects, and swimming invertebrates, and, as such, this exercise provides a useful roadmap for targeted deployments and data syntheses that should advance the field of movement ecology.

abstract = {Analysing behavioural sequences and quantifying the likelihood of occurrences of different behaviours is a difficult task as motivational states are not observable. Furthermore, it is ecologically highly relevant and yet more complicated to scale an appropriate model for one individual up to the population level. In this manuscript (mixed) hidden Markov models ({HMMs}) are used to model the feeding behaviour of 54 subadult grey mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus), small nocturnal primates endemic to Madagascar that forage solitarily. Our primary aim is to introduce ecologists and other users to various {HMM} methods, many of which have been developed only recently, and which in this form have not previously been synthesized in the ecological literature. Our specific application of mixed {HMMs} aims at gaining a better understanding of mouse lemur behaviour, in particular concerning sex-specific differences. The model we consider incorporates random effects for accommodating heterogeneity across animals, i.e. accounts for different personalities of the animals. Additional subject- and time-specific covariates in the model describe the influence of sex, body mass and time of night.}
