# Introduction {#sec-intro}

##	History of fish tagging/biologging

**Say sth about short term tagging mortality **

- Different telemetry methods

##	Acoustic telemetry

##	Acoustic data storage tags

###	Geolocation modelling

- Method: HMM with observation and behavioural model
- Different techniques for behavioural states
- Spectral method by Heerah 2017
- Tidal method by Pedersen 2008
- Drawbacks of the methods for species with limited knowledge, a benthic lifestyle with a broad range of horizontal movement

##	The starry smooth-hound shark

*put knowledge about the species into context of related species*

###	Morphology

<!-- IMAGE: starry smooth-hound -->

- Ventral snout: perfect for feeding on animals on seafloor
- All time spent swimming above seafloor

###	Ecology

####	Life history

- Feeding: crustaceans, swimming shorewards at night

####	Migration

- Sex bias: Males into Northern North Sea, females into Bay of Biscay

- Daily horizontal distance: up to 70km

####	Reproduction

- Aplacentary viviparous, unlike M. mustelus but e.g. like M. antarcticus
- Different life stages of young
- Multiple paternity, sperm storage up to a year

###	Research gaps

#### Migration
sex bias known, but no exact locations, timing also unknown

-	Horizontal and vertical behaviour during migration
-	Until now, many capture/recapture studies, but no in-depth tracking studies (to our knowledge)

####	Reproduction
reproductive habitats already studied to some extent, but e.g. parturition site Western Scheldt unconfirmed

  -	General details about parturition: all pups released at once, batches?
  
###	Abundance

- only species in NE Atlantic

##	Communication of fish movement ecology studies

###	Problem
the data is complex and difficult to understand for non-experts, yet it is imperative to communicate the scientific results to transform them into action/change

###	The quadruple helix

- 	Communication from (fish) scientists to politicians to inform political and fishery management decisions
-	Creating awareness within the general public
-	Information of industry stakeholders, e.g. wind farm companies

##	Aims of the work

### 	Characterizing the vertical behaviour (i.e. the depthlogs) of the migrating sharks

-	Motivation: provide additional input for geolocation models(Behavioural switches)
-	Implement unsupervised learning aka k means clustering to infer behavioural states/switches = test a new way of inferring behavioural states

####	Working hypothesis

Using k-means on summary statistics and their wavelet analysis results successfully identifies putative migration periods, as identified by visual analysis of the raw depthlog

###	Exploratory and descriptive analysis of the female sharks’ vertical behaviour

in the Western Scheldt using the acoustic detections data

-	Sub-dataset of July 2019 since this has the highest density of acoustic detections (~6000 out of ~10000 total detections)

####	Working hypothesis

Sharks predominantly use the seafloor section of the space around a receiver (predominantly = xx%, or result of chi2?)

####	Working hypotheses about the acoustic dataset in general

the seasonal presence of M. asterias is reflected in the acoustic detection dataset

-	H0 = the mean # detections per month in summer months, here: March – September significantly differs from that in winter months (t-test or Levene test)

<!-- PLOT (maybe: boxplot, winter vs summer months, detections grouped into months) -->

the sex bias, i.e. that females are predominantly present in the WS, is reflected in the acoustic detections
-	H0 = number of females detected per month significantly differs from the number of males (t test)

###	Converting the first results
into a format that transmit relevant messages to one/several groups of non-scientists

-	No working hypothesis, bc only concept and first draft version, but outlook: further development and then study with people about how well they understood the information provided

<!-- State that most of the analyses are descriptive/exploratory bc not much is known about the species yet and the dataset Is a bit too small to perform real statistical tests on -->

##	The Permanent Belgian Receiver Network (PBARN)

The acoustic receivers of the Permanent Belgian Receiver Network (PBARN) were used in this study. The PBARN is part of the European Tracking Network, which was established in 2017 as a pan-european aquatic telemetry network [@reubens_2019].
As of 2019, the PBARN consisted of 177 permanently installed and monitored acoustic receivers within the BPNS, the Scheldt Estuary, the Dijle, Rupel, Albert Canal and the Meuse River [@reubens_2018].
A detection probability of >50% was estimated for a radius of 500-700m around the receiver [@goossens_2022], and >70% for 200m radius [@reubens_2018].

*Find out: how many receivers were in the BPNS and the Scheldt?*

### Data Management (change title)

The database of the European Tracking Network (https://lifewatch.be/etn) stores the acoustic detections, and metadata connected to the animal individuals and the tags used. <!-- make etn link into citation -->
The data storage log files and the outputs of the geolocation models were accessed and management via the Marine Data Archive (MDA).

<!-- - *Question: TABLE with lat lon & names of receiver stations?* noooo right? --> 

## Acoustic Tags 

The *M. asterias* individuals were equipped with *Innovasea* ADST-V13TP tags, measuring 46mm in length and weighing 13g. Each tag had an estimated battery lifetime of 518 days, and contained a pressure and a temperature sensor with logging intervals of 120s and 240s, respectively. For each acoustic detection, a pressure or temperature value was transmitted with a ratio of 1:3 (pressure:temperature). Further details about the tags can be found in the Supporting Information of @goossens_2023.
<!-- reference to innovasea product manual -->
The pressure sensors recorded with a resolution of 0.3m and an accuracy of $\pm$ 3.4m until the depth of 68m, according to the manufacturer (**ref**).

## Tagging Procedure

```{r sum-tagging}
tagging_info <- masterias_info %>% mutate(date = release_date_time %>% lubridate::date(),                        release_loc = ifelse(release_latitude > 51.53, "Neeltje Jans", "outside WS")) %>% group_by(date) %>% reframe(n = n(), release_loc = release_loc %>% unique()) %>% mutate(date2 = date %>% format(format = "%B %d"))

# tagging_info %>% View()
```


Tagging of the 30 *M. asterias* individuals occured in July and August, 2018 (`r tagging_info$date2[1]`, n = `r tagging_info$n[1]`, `r tagging_info$date2[2]` and 03, n = `r tagging_info$n[2]` and n = `r tagging_info$n[3]`) and in July, 2019 (`r tagging_info$date2[4]` and 12, n = `r tagging_info$n[4]` for both dates).
Tagged animals were both caught and released in two locations, just west of *Neeltje Jans* (all individuals tagged in July, both 2018 and 2019), and outside the mouth of the Western Scheldt (all individuals tagged in August 2018). The two locations are shown in @fig-map2detail.

Animals were caught using line fishing or handline. After capture, each animal was placed in a holding tank filled with sea water. Before the surgery the animals were turned with the ventral side facing upwards to induce tonic immobility [@kessel_2015] and the midventral line was incised 2-3 cm with a scalpel. Next, the Acoustic Data Storage Tag was inserted into the abdominal cavity with forceps, and the incision was closed with 2-3 stitches of non-absorbable mono-filament [@goossens_2023].

<!-- Photo of tagging?? PJV? -->

## Ethics statement

The care and use of the 30 *M. asterias* individuals complied with the Belgian Animal Welfare Act,
guidelines and policies as approved by the *Ethische Commissie Dierproeven* (project
reference EC2017-080). All animal treatments were undertaken in 2018 and 2019, and all tagging procedures were carried out by competent and trained personal license holders.

##	Data Analysis and visualisation

All data analyses were carried out using R [@R_2022], primarily using the packages *'dplyr'* and *'lubridate'*. All maps were created using the *'leaflet'*-package. Geospatial data, where not otherwise indicated, was queried from *marineregions.org* in the case of (marine) boundaries (with the *'mregions2'*-package), and *EMODnet* for human activities data (with the *'EMODnetWFS'*-package). All plots were generated using the *'ggplot2'*-package. Packages used for specific data analyses are indicated in the respective section.
<!-- To Do: name all required packages for an analysis -->

###	Acoustic Detections

Detections were accessed from the ETN database. Tags with only a single detection were omitted from all further analyses. 
Summary statistics describing seasonal shark presence around the receivers in the Western Scheldt were calculated: The number of detections and individuals detected at each receiver, per month (*rephrase*).

*To compare shark presence around the receivers in the Western Scheldt between seasons, an ANOVA was executed. (**TO DO**)*.

####	Vertical space use analysis

To assess the vertical space use of sharks detected in the WS 1 array, the depths transmitted with the detections were compared to the bathymetry composition around each receiver. A bathymetry dataset from the Flemish government (publication date: November 18, 2019) was used. The dataset had a 1m x 1m resolution and contains the mean depth per grid cell. The seafloor depth within a radius of 200m around each receiver was extracted using the *'sf'*-package in R. The 200m refer to the probability of >70% of an acoustic detection [@reubens_2019].
The following was done both for the bathymetry subsets and the acoustic detections for each receiver station in the WS1 array: Firstly, the maximum and minimum depth (of seafloor depth and acoustic detections) around each receiver were extracted, and the percentage of grid cells/detections that contained a depth value within a 10m depth bin (spanning from 0m to -50m) was computed.


<!-- make reference to dataset: https://madame.vlaanderen.be/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/718dc576-7ddc-43b5-b71e-3bd3617e1bd3 -->


###	Data Storage Tags

Depth and temperature logs from the recovered tags were accessed via the Marine Data Archive (MDA).
<!-- TODO: link URL -->
The temperature log was not included in any analysis.
The first week of depth values was excluded from all analyses, to remove potential bias resulting from the tagging procedure [cf. @flavio_2021]. The date of death, used to calculate the time at liberty, was visually extracted from plots of the raw depth series, and marks the date after which only a tidal signal remains in the depthlog, which is characterised by cyclically rising and falling depths within a rough 2m interval.
<!-- Potentially automate this -->

Only depthlogs that logged for >=365 (*code to make sign prettier*) days where included in the migration period analyses described below. Those will be referred to as *long term DST depthlogs* in the following.
<!-- maybe rephrase: "excluded from all analyses" -->
Summary statistics (mean, median, maximum, minimum depth, and depth range) were calculated per hour, day/night, date, week and month. For all of these calculated summary statistics, the daily change was computed (i.e. * variable~change~ = variable~t~ - variable~t-1~). For the day/night summaries, sunrise and sunset times were extracted using the *'suncalc'*-package. On the daily summaries, a rolling mean with a window size of 3 days was applied to smooth the data. **Prior to spectral analyses, the data was centred and normalised, resulting in a mean of 0 and a sd of 1.** 
<!-- check: sollte ich das noch machen?? -->
The animal's vertical speed (in *m/min*) was calculated following @griffiths_2020, dividing the depth difference between two consecutive measurements by the time interval (in min).
<!-- ToDo: debate if the above should be included (is it suuper relevant? only if the vert speed is included in wavelet analyses) -->

####	Migration Period Analysis

Firstly, a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was performed on the raw longterm DST depthlogs, using the *'base::fft()'*-function. This method decomposes a signal in the time domain (which is a combination of multiple sine waves with different frequencies) into its components in the frequency domain. Dominant frequencies (or rather periods, which is the inverse of the frequency) give insights about the scale of periodicity of a signal (in the present case the signal is the depth-timeseries). 
<!-- give fft source -->

Secondly, Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) was performed on the daily summary statistics of the longterm DST depthlogs, using the *'biwavelet'*-package. This method gives insights into the occurrence of certain frequencies within the time domain, in contrast to FFT. Thus, not only information about the dominant frequencies is gathered, but also when in the time signal those frequencies appear. In order to resolve the components of the frequency domain within the time domain, however, the resolution of both is minimised (following Heisenberg's uncertainty principle). To obtain robust and valid results despite the resolution loss, frequencies were compared against white noise using a chi square test. Only frequencies that significantly differed from white noise were incorporated into further analyses.
<!-- give CWT source -->

Thirdly, the daily summary statistics and the results from the wavelet analysis (i.e., significantly present periods per day), were used as input for k-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. Unsupervised (as opposed to supervised) learning was utilised in this case because it does not require a training dataset with known right answers (which in this case would be the days that the sharks are migrating).
The algorithm was run n = 100 (**DO!**) times each for a number of clusters from 1 to 8. The optimal number of clusters was identified using the *elbow*-method (**reference**).

Next, FFT was performed on each cluster separately, after the predominant cluster per week was assigned to all data points within that week. The last step was done to smooth the clustering result and reclassify potential outliers.
In addition, CWT was performed on the hourly summary statistics for each cluster.

### Summary statistics {#sec-results-dst-summary}

<!-- Noch ueberlegen wie ich das mit den Plots mache, weil ich gern alle 4 plots in einer figure vereinen wuerde -->

The summary statistics of the depthlogs of tags 308 and 321 are displayed below.
<!-- in @fig-dstsum. -->
<!-- Let's check if the cross referencing of sections works, see @sec-intro. -->

**To Do: incorporate 2nd y axis for depth median change**

<!-- Daily summary statistics for tag 308 and tag 321. The black line shows the daily median (not the mean because depth values are not normally distributed) with a rolling mean of 3 days. The grey ribbon spans between the daily maximum and minimum depth. The purple curve shows the change of daily median depth. The coloured bars represent the vertical movement behaviour per day as classified by a chi square test that compares the depths at night to the depths during the day.(depth (night) significantly shallower/deeper than depth (day): Diel Vertical Migration (DVM)/reverse DVM (rDVM), no significant difference: no DVM (nDVM)).  -->

### Unsupervised learning


<!-- ix.	wavelet plot and frequency spectrum of putative migration period raw depthlogs -->

# Discussion

<!-- Discuss working hypotheses, critical analysis of the interpretation of the data, compared to the available literature -->

##	Seasonality of starry smooth-hound presence 
in/around westerschelde, according to ac. detections

-	Highly seasonal (only in summer)
-	Sex-biased (mostly females)
-	Possible pupping area, but this dataset not sufficient to confirm

### Vertical space use analysis

The results show deeper waters utilised by *M. asterias* around a receiver than contained in the bathymetry grid used. This can have several reasons: 
1. The depth per grid cell is the mean depth in that cell, thus deeper depths are present most likely.
2. The shark was detected within a radius more than 200m away from the receiver, where the water is deeper.
3. The bathymetry grid does not match the actual conditions in the water at the time of detection, both due to the resolution of the grid and the highly dynamic, sandy environment with high possibility of changing depths.

##	Tag recoveries

###	Possible death reasons of short term dst’s

-	Tagging consequences
-	High sensitivity (verhelst, pers. Comm.)
-	Not likely: death bc of seals (no temp increase)
-	Laying dead on seafloor (tidal signal)

##	Ecological inferences from migration dataset analysis

###	Vertical patterns during migration

-	Yes, but eventually swimming inshore
-	How strong are diel patterns in putative migration weeks? Check wavelet median depth

##	Limits of biologging/ fish tagging

-	Geolocation modelling already leads to impressive results for comparatively well-studied species (e.g. cod (?), sea bass), but still limited in accuracy for not wellknown species

###	Limits of geolocation modelling

-	Resolution of bathymetry dataset
  -	Possible that shark was in certain area but bc bathymetry grid = summary (e.g. mean), geolocation model rules this location out (cf Woillez 2016)
-	Behaviour incorrectly/not inferred
  -	E.g. active vs inactive behaviour: 
  
### current state of fish tagging

-	It’s kind of the best we can do today, but non-satellite tagging methodologies have huge drawbacks still
-	Acoustic telemetry: high resolution on regional scale (i.e. where the receivers are placed) but outside of receiver networks: no knowledge at all

##	Limits of the chosen analysis methods

-	Wavelet analysis: no super fine scale analysis possible bc of limited res in both time and freq domain

##	Limits of the acoustic detection dataset

-	There are ~10 000 detections within ~2 yrs but compared to other studies (ref to other studies!) this is not that much.
-	the horiz resolution of receivers, esp in/around the WS is not good bc rather receiver gate than array to monitor species swimming into/out of the Scheldt river (= different use case scenario: receiver array needed to resolve locations of sharks better, and to e.g. enable triangulation)

##	Limits of the data storage tag dataset

-	Female shark: deeper than tag depth limit (68m): geolocation model inaccurate, shark putatively went into the Hurd deep (MRGID: 3321) in English channel
-	Only one individual per sex: not reliable, no statistics possible

# Conclusion

*brief summary of the main findings (original data, lesson learned,…)*

-	Possible improvements of tagging procedure (correct place here?)

# Outlook

*Alle kapitel aus der Einleitung wieder aufnehmen*

##	Acoustic detections additional analyses
-	Vertical space use: resolve individuals to see if there are differences between ind. Sharks
##	Improvements of geolocation model for M. asterias
-	Boundary condition: max depth of fish per day == max depth of bathy for that day
-	Behavioural switch: migration/non-migration or migration/winter resident/summer resident
##	Information tool
- make into interactive application (RShiny) and do tests with some of the target groups to understand how well the information is taken in
