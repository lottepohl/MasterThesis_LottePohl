# Questions to Jan, Niels and Carlota {-}
1. active or passive style of writing? I learned to write passively but I see a lot of active writing in literature (i.e. we did this instead of this was done)

2. how should I include the geolocation model output of tag 308 and 321? It is not sth that I did, so it should not go in my results. Thus, intro? and how? It would be nice to show a map and underneath the raw depth- and temperature log. But these logs are kind of a result, and I want to put the raw plots in my results section to build up on that. But then I have sth similar both in the intro and the results? I cannot do that..

3. how do I structure my results best? I am indecisive between making 1 big figure per tag containing the raw depth and temp log, the autocorrelation plot, the fft periodogram and the daily summary statistics&vertical movement. In my eyes, this makes the most sense since then you have all result plots at once for each tag, but it also is a lot of information and might be overwhelming. The alternative would be to make subchapters for `daily summaries`, `fft`, `raw depthlogs` etc and plot all plots from the same category for each tag. What do you think would be best?

4. I have trouble defining the study area: is the study area the BPNS and the Scheldt, because there sharks were tagged? What are the greater north sea and the english channel for the study, as sharks putatively moved there during migration?
I find it important to introduce those habitats as well, because in the discussion I want to talk about food availability and living conditions in the english channel & northern north sea to relate to the putative migration paths. But it also gets long in the methods to describe all 4 areas: the BPNS, the Scheldt Estuary

5. Do you think that a linear model trying to relate daily summary statistics to identified migration behaviour could make sense. Having the behavioural state (migratory/resident) as dependent variable, and then trying daily median/max/min, but also the vertical migration behaviour, the most prominent periods and maybe even things like the temperature range as independent variables?

# Introduction {#sec-intro}

*problem statement: migratory fish, large migrations, management and conservation needed, sharks especially vulnerable, lead to M. asterias*.

##	Acquatic telemetry

Telemetry refers to the remote monitoring of animals using electronic transmitters or tags,	and receivers [@whoriskey_2019], allowing for the  tracking of marine animal movement. A multitude of telemetry methods exists today, popular technologies to study acquatic animals include acoustic telemetry and archival telemetry [@thorstad_2013].
<!-- satellite telemetry,  -->
Telemetry enables the quantification of animal migrations and (vertical and horizontal) habitat use [@hussey_2015], which informs species management and conservation spanning in marine, freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems [@beger_2010].

<!-- Satellite telemetry involves satellites that receive signals from a tag attached to animal, requiring the tag to breach the water surface for signal transmission (**ref**). -->

Acoustic telemetry refers to the use of acoustic receivers that are placed in the water column which can detect acoustic signals emitted from a tag within a certain range. Such networks exist primarily in shallow, coastal areas of countries with sufficient financial resources to maintain the receivers [@hussey_2015]. Examples include the Acoustic Tracking Array Platform (ATAP) in South Africa [@cowley_2017] and the Permanent Belgian Acoustic Receiver Network [PBARN, @reubens_2019]. 

<!-- maybe include: Recently,	 a	shift	 from	 mobile	 tracking	 towards	 using	 fixed	 receiving	stations	that	automatically	log	detections	has	led	to	a	large	number	 of	tagged	animals	and	extensive	receiver	coverage	crossing	geopolitical	boundaries	 (Donaldson	 et	al.,	2014). from whoriskey 2017 -->

Archival telemetry uses tags or biologgers that locally store recorded data about water pressure, temperature and other environmental variables. Popup Satellite Archival Tags (PSAT) disattach from the animal and float to the surface, transmitting recorded data to satellites, while Data Storage Tags (DST) require the retrieval of the tag for downloading data [@thorstad_2013].

Acoustic data storage tags (ADST) are a combination tag, merging acoustic and data storage tags [@goossens_2023]. As such, the tag emits unique acoustic signals that can be detected by an acoustic receiver within a certain range, and additionally records water pressure in predefined intervals.

Different telemetry methods result in different datasets. 
In acoustic telemetry, recorded data contains the time that a specific tag was detected by a specific receiver (with a known location), resulting in an irregular time series (i.e., a time series with irregularly spaced observations). These datasets are in a horizontal dimension, i.e., with a latitude and longitude position.

Archival telemetry generates regular time series in pre-defined intervals, logging water depth (most importantly) and other environmental variables. These datasets are in a vertical dimension, spanning the depth range of the waters the animal moves in.

ADST datasets contain timestamps of the tag's detection at a specific acoustic receiver, and, in case the tag was recovered, logs of water depth and other variables (temperature, for example).

##	Geolocation modelling

Geolocation models are a common method to infer the latitude and longitude (i.e., the horizontal dimension) of a DST log (which is in a vertical dimension).
These models use the seafloor bathymetry in combination with other environmental variables such as temperature to estimate the most likely path that was taken by the animal. 

@pedersen_2008 introduced a geolocation model using Hidden Markov Models (HMM), which was refined by @woillez_2016. The method by @woillez_2016 involves a HMM with an observation and a behavioural model.

*go more in depth*

<!-- - Method: HMM with observation and behavioural model -->
<!-- - behavioural switches improve geolocation models significantly [@pedersen_2008]. -->
<!-- *First talk about geolocation modelling in general, and then describe M. asterias behaviours in the chapter about m. asterias, in the aims state that possible improvements of the m. asterias geolocation model exceeding behavioural states will be discussed* -->

<!-- **Where do I put the geolocation results of Jolien? In the introduction or in the discussion? I kind of need to put them in the intro because I am referring to them a lot...** -->

## Inferring behavioural states

<!-- - Different techniques for behavioural states -->
<!-- - Spectral method by Heerah 2017 -->
<!-- - Tidal method by Pedersen 2008 -->
<!-- - Drawbacks of the methods for species with limited knowledge, a benthic lifestyle with a broad range of horizontal movement -->

In response to their environment and internal ecophysiological processes, animals exhibit different behaviours. The change from one behavioural 'state' to another is referred to as behavioural switching [@gurarie_2016].

Detecting such switches and linking them to environmental factors, amongst others, is an important part of animal movement ecology and can inform species conservation and management [@hays_2016]. 
<!-- drinlassen? -->

For marine animals equipped with data storage tags, several methods to identify behavioural states have been proposed. These inferred states can be used as additional input for the geolocation model. @pedersen_2008 used tidal patterns to identify resting periods in Atlantic cod *Gadus morhua*, and @heerah_2017 used a combination of spectral analysis (Short Term Fourier Transform STFT) and Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to identify behavioural switches in European seabass *Dicentrarchus labrax*. 

The method by @pedersen_2008 requires the animal to rest on the seafloor for a certain time period such that a tidal signal is detectable in the depth-time series. @heerah_2017 used STFT which differs from regular Fourier Transformation (FT) by the use of a rolling window, within which the FT is computed. The STFT result is then used as input for a HMM framework, which can detect underlying unknown (or *hidden*) behavioural states [@schliehediecks_2012]. The choice of window size determines the scale of detected cyclical patterns by the FT, and as such also influence the nature and number of  hidden states detected by the HMM. HMM tend to overestimate the number of hidden states, making it challenging to interpret the detected states from an ecological standpoint. This is especially difficult when information on the behaviour of a species is lacking, or if the species has a large horizontal range of movement.
Furthermore, the development of a robust HMM framework requires time and experience, and was beyond the scope of this study. 

<!-- comparison between marine and terrestrial methods to infer behaviour -->
The analysis and segmentation of behavioural states is much more explored for data in the horizontal dimension than in the vertical dimension (**ref**).
Satellite-recorded movement of marine animals can be analysed with a hierarchical Switching State Space Model [SSSM, @francis_2019].
<!-- For terrestrial animals, the analysis and segmentation of behaviours is much more explored (**ref**).  -->
Other commonly emplyed methods include Behaviural Change Point Analysis [BCPA, @gurarie_2009] or wavelet decomposition [@soleymani_2017]. Terrestrial animal movement data naturally come in a horizontal domain (i.e., with latitude and longitude) through the ability to use the satellite-based Global Positioning System (GPS). Data storage tags record water pressure (and other variables), and thus the data structure is vertical. The challenge for data storage tags is to infer the horizontal domain (the latitude and longitude over time) from the vertical data (the water pressure over time) as accurately as possible. Since terrestrial animal movement data lack this step, behavioural segmentation methods developed for terrestrial animals cannot directly be applied to marine animal movement data.

### Change Point Detection

<!-- why I did CPD -->
It can be insightful, however, to gather inspiration from terrestrial behaviour segmentation methods. A simpler version of BCPA, for instance, is Change Point Detection (CPD).
<!-- For the present study, a basic version of BCPA was applied to a vertical movement dataset from a demersal shark: Change Point Detection (CPD).  -->
CPD algorithms are designed to detect abrupt changes in signals. An abrupt change occurs very fast compared to the data sampling period, with somewhat constant properties before and after the change [@basseville_1993, pp.1-2]. CPD is a well-explored method in statistics which can also be employed on time series signals [@liu_2013].
Retrospective (i.e., not real-time) CPD algorithms compare the probability distributions of subsequent samples and a change point occurs when the probability distributions significantly differ. 
CPD detection is an unsupervised learning technique that, in contrast to unsupervised clustering algorithms like k-means, compares subsequent samples, thus implementing the time aspect in the learning process.
Details about the CPD algorithm chosen for the present study are explained in @sec-mm_migration.

##	The starry smooth-hound shark

<!-- *put knowledge about the species into context of related species* -->

The starry smooth-hound shark (*Mustelus asterias*, Cloquet 1819) is a medium-sized triakid elasmobranch, measuring around 30 cm in total length (TL) at birth and 100 cm (males) and 120 cm (females) when reaching sexual maturity [@farrell_2010]. It can attain up to 140 cm TL [@mccullyphillips_2015]. Sexual maturity is reached at 4-5 and 6 years of age for males and females, respectively, and longevity is 13 years and 18 years for males and females, respectively @farrell_2010.


###	Abundance

- only species in NE Atlantic
- continue

### Reproductive behaviour
<!-- *M. asterias* has a complex reproduction behaviour. -->
*M. asterias* is aplacentally viviparous (i.e. embryos are absorb nutrients from a yolk sack that is used up during gestation). It displays polyandry (i.e., one female mating with several males within one breeding season) and multiple paternity [i.e., pups within one litter originating from several males, @farrell_2014].
Moreover, it has a biennally gestation cycle with a gestation period of about 12 months, followed by a 12-month resting period. *M. asterias* females can store sperm for up to 12 months [@farrell_2010a]. The same study found embryos from different developmental stages in gestating females (termed embryo asynchronism).
@griffiths_2020 reported philopatric behaviour (i.e., females returning to the same area for parturition) for the first time. 
Identified parturition grounds for *M. asterias* include the Eastern Scheldt and, more generally, the Bristol Channel, Southern North Sea and the English Channel [@dureuil_2013; @mccullyphillips_2015; @breve_2016]. Pupping possibly takes place in the months between april and september [@farrell_2010a; @mccullyphillips_2015].

###	Feeding behaviour

<!-- IMAGE: starry smooth-hound -->

Its ventrally located snout enables it to feed on prey on the seafloor, indicating that it swims closely above the seafloor during foraging and preying (**ref**).

<!-- - Ventral snout: perfect for feeding on animals on seafloor -->
<!-- - All time spent swimming above seafloor -->

*M. asterias* is a specialist feeder on benthic and suprabenthic crustaceans, common prey include the hermit crab (*Pagurus bernhardus*), the flying crab (*Liocarcinus holsatus*), the common shore crab (*Carcinus maenas*) and the edible crab (*Cancer pagurus*) [@mccullyphillips_2015; @mccullyphillips_2020]. 
Potential predators of *M. asterias* are the grey seal (*Halichoerus grypus*) which occurs in the North Sea, the blue shark (*Prionace glauca*) and the common dolphin (*Delphinus delphis*), both of which occur in the Western English Channel [@griffiths_2020].

<!-- - Feeding: crustaceans, swimming shorewards at night -->

### Migration

- 1 sentence about the potential of two populations in the greater north sea, and one population going into the Scheldt Estuary in summer [@breve_2016].

Annual migration is part of the life cycle of adult *M. asterias*, with females moving into the English Channel and the Bay of Biscay, and males moving into the Northern North Sea and into the English Channel [@breve_2020]. Potential reasons of this sex-specific migration are females avoiding mating, resource competition, or reduction of embryo mortality [@speed_2010].


##### Geolocation Model Results

@goossens_2023 used a geolocation model approach with a two-state HMM following the geolocation approach by @woillez_2016. The inferred daily locations of two *M. asterias* individuals tagged in 2018 are shown in @fig-mapgeolocation.

```


<!-- also found in other sharks, eg the tope shark (Colloca 2019, from breve 2020) -->

<!-- - Sex bias: Males into Northern North Sea, females into Bay of Biscay -->

<!-- - Daily horizontal distance: up to 70km (**ref!**) -->

### Daily behaviour

<!-- - daily vertical migration: present (find source), but also (most likely) horizontal movement associated with the vertical movement, i.e. the animal stays on the seafloor and swims shorewards during the night, feeding on crustaceans (?) -->

*M. asterias* shows higher vertical activity during night than during the day, indicating prey searching and foraging behaviour at night, which is commonly oberved in elasmobranchs. During the day, it potentially avoids predation by exhibiting resting or sheltering behaviour [@griffiths_2020]. 



###	Research gaps

#### Relevance of the Study
@griffiths_2020 identified seabed association of *M. asterias* as a research gap.
@breve_2020 advised to further research *M. asterias* with a combination of telemetry and genetic techniques.

#### Migration
sex bias known, but no exact locations, timing also unknown

-	Horizontal and vertical behaviour during migration
-	Until now, many capture/recapture studies, but no in-depth tracking studies (to our knowledge)

####	Reproduction
reproductive habitats already studied to some extent, but e.g. parturition site Western Scheldt unconfirmed

  -	General details about parturition: all pups released at once, batches?

##	Communication of fish movement ecology studies

*not sure if include at all or not*

<!-- ###	Problem -->
<!-- the data is complex and difficult to understand for non-experts, yet it is imperative to communicate the scientific results to transform them into action/change -->

<!-- ###	The quadruple helix -->

<!-- - 	Communication from (fish) scientists to politicians to inform political and fishery management decisions -->
<!-- -	Creating awareness within the general public -->
<!-- -	Information of industry stakeholders, e.g. wind farm companies -->

##	Aims of the work

*rewrite*

The aims of this work are threefold. The first two aims involve DST data, the third aim involves acoustic detections of *M. asterias*:

<!-- Problem here: how do I describe my aims before explaining how many sharks were tagged and how many tags we got back? -->

  1. An ecologcial descrition and characterisation of the Data Storage Tag depthlogs
  2. The implementation of a simple method to detect behavioural switches in the depthlogs of migrating sharks (*rephrase*)
  3. Assessing the depth use/vertical habitat use of female *M. asterias just outside of the Western Scheldt during summer.*

Relevant research gaps on *M. asterias* involve the species' sex-biased migration routes and periods. Due to its benthic lifestyle, no satellite tags can be employed, requiring geolocation modelling of Data Storage Tags. Including behavioural states into a geolocation model increases its reliability. 
@goossens_2023 modelled DST data from *M. asterias* without behaviorual switches. The present study implements a simple method to detect change points in a time series signal in order to infer behavioural states from depth time series *M. asterias* that span $\geq$ 365 days.

### 	Characterizing the vertical behaviour (i.e. the depthlogs) of the migrating sharks

-	Motivation: provide additional input for geolocation models(Behavioural switches)
-	Implement unsupervised learning in the form of Change Point Detection to infer behavioural states/switches = test a new, simple way of inferring behavioural switches.

####	Working hypothesis

Using Change Point Detection on daily summary statistics successfully identifies putative migration periods, as identified by visual analysis of the raw depthlog.

###	Exploratory and descriptive analysis of the female sharks’ vertical behaviour

in the Western Scheldt using the acoustic detections data

-	Sub-dataset of July 2019 since this has the highest density of acoustic detections (~6000 out of ~10000 total detections)

####	Working hypothesis

Sharks predominantly use the seafloor section of the space around a receiver (predominantly = xx%, or result of chi2?)

####	Working hypotheses about the acoustic dataset in general

the seasonal presence of M. asterias is reflected in the acoustic detection dataset

-	H0 = the mean # detections per month in summer months, here: March – September significantly differs from that in winter months (t-test or Levene test)

<!-- PLOT (maybe: boxplot, winter vs summer months, detections grouped into months) -->

the sex bias, i.e. that females are predominantly present in the WS, is reflected in the acoustic detections
-	H0 = number of females detected per month significantly differs from the number of males (t test)

###	Converting the first results
into a format that transmit relevant messages to one/several groups of non-scientists

**Do not make into aim, too little done in the thesis ** -> move to outlook?

-	No working hypothesis, bc only concept and first draft version, but outlook: further development and then study with people about how well they understood the information provided

###	The BPNS and Scheldt Estuary

The Belgian Part of the North Sea (BPNS) is generally characterised by shallow water depths below 40 m [@thierry_2019], sandy or muddy sediment [@vasquez_2021] and multiple sandbanks and troughs. 
Artificial structures resulting from human activities, such as shipwrecks and Offshore Wind Farms (OWF), provide hard substrate.
Apart from seafaring and energy production, shipping, fishing (including trawling) or sand and gravel extraction take place in the BPNS [@chen_2005; @douvere_2007]. Furthermore, submarine cables to facilitate energy transport and telecommunication have been present in the North Sea for decades [@degroot_1979].
The river Scheldt meets the North Sea north of the border between the Netherlands and Belgium, forming an Estuary with a complex regime of sandflats and channels [@claessens_1988].
Both the BPNS and the Scheldt Estuary are highly mixed due to strong currents and tides [@otto_1990], introducing saline waters well into the Scheldt Estuary [@ouboter_1998].
The Scheldt Estuary is characterised by medium to coarse sand and salinity between ranges 2 and 33.5 ppt [@baeyens_1998], peaking in summer [@maes_1998]. The seafloor depth averages around 11m with occasional troughs of up to 20 or 30m [@thierry_2019]. 
The lower part of the Scheldt Estuary from Vlissingen (The Netherlands) 55-60 km upstream is referred to as Western Scheldt Estuary[@baeyens_1998; @ouboter_1998].
Between Bergen op Zoom and the island Neeltje Jans (both Netherlands), the Estuary is referred to as the Eastern Scheldt Estuary.
An overview map of the BPNS and the Scheldt Estuary is provided in @fig-mapdetail.
Fish and crustacean species composition and abundance underlies strong seasonal patterns, peaking in summer [@maes_1998; @maes_2005]. Seasonally occuring species are marine fish like Atlantic herring (*Clupea harengus*), Sprat (*Sprattus sprattus*) or Whiting (*Merlangius merlangus*), and abundant crustacean species include the common shrimp (*Crangon crangon*) and the palaemonid shrimp [*Palaemon varians*, @maes_1998].

###	The English channel

The English Channel (EC) extends from the Dover Strait to England's southwestern tip, spanning 77 000 km^2^ [@dauvin_2012]. The mean seafloor depth increases from around 25 m in the east to 75m in the west [@dauvin_2012], except for the 174 m deep *Hurd deep*, a trench located close to the Channel Island Guernsey.
An overview of the English Channel and the North Sea is provided in @fig-mapoverview.
Shipping, fishing and granulate extraction occurs all over the EC region [@dauvin_2015]. Strong tidal currents from west to east are present, which are higher on the French than on the English coast due to Coriolis force, reaching maximum values of 8 knots at the Cap de la Hague [@salomon_1993]. Tidal circulation influences the composition of superficial seafloor sediments with coarse sediments dominating in areas of strong tidal currents and fine and muddy sediments dominating in bays and estuaries with weaker tidal currents as well as on the English Coast [@larsonneur_1982].
From the western end up to Guernsey and the Hurd Deep, stratification occurs in summer, which is broken down as water progresses towards the east, resulting no vertical temperature gradient to be present in the eastern EC [@holme_1966]. Seafloor temperatures vary less in the western EC (range: 9$^\circ$C to 14$^\circ$C) than in the eastern EC (8$^\circ$C and 16$^\circ$C).
Species living on the seafloor include Crustacea like the edible crab (*Cancer pagurus*), the common spider crab (*Maja squinado*), the European lobster (*Homarus gammarus*) and *Upogebia spp.* [@holme_1966; @vaz_2007].

##	The Permanent Belgian Receiver Network (PBARN)

The acoustic receivers of the Permanent Belgian Receiver Network (PBARN) were used in this study. The PBARN is part of the European Tracking Network, which was established in 2017 as a pan-european aquatic telemetry network [@reubens_2019].
As of 2019, the PBARN consisted of 177 permanently installed and monitored acoustic receivers within the BPNS, the Scheldt Estuary, the Dijle, Rupel, Albert Canal and the Meuse River [@reubens_2018].
A detection probability of >50% was estimated for a radius of 500-700m around the receiver [@goossens_2022], and >70% for 200m radius [@reubens_2018].



<!-- rewrite, from goossens 2016 -->
<!-- The  data  originated  from   6  2     self  -  contained,  single  channe  l  (69  kHz),  submersible     Vemco     acoustic   receivers  . These receivers were attached to buoys and/or   bottom moorings     and were removed either   manually, either with an acoustic release system.   23     acoustic receivers were   deployed     in the BPNS at   spread out position  s and 39 were set up in the Scheldt Estuary in three receiver   array  s. These receivers   were  categorized  into  four  locations,  based  on  their  positions:  offshore,  coast,  Western  and  Eastern   Scheldt  Estuary.  From  July  2014   until   July  2015,  36  fish  were     caught   by  hand  -  line  and     tagged  with  a   Vemco V9  -  1L transmitter with a unique ID, emitting a signal every 110 to 250 seconds     (Vemco 2016)  .

*To Do:*
- put all receiver stations in map (also those further up the river)
- include outlines of the Western and Eastern Scheldt
- include outlines of the French and Dutch EEZ and make one colour for EEZ
- indicate the WS1 and the WS2 array (esp. for vertical space use analysis for acoustic detections)

### Data Management

*change title*
 
The database of the European Tracking Network (https://lifewatch.be/etn) stores the acoustic detections, and metadata connected to the animal individuals and the tags used. <!-- make etn link into citation -->
The data storage log files and the outputs of the geolocation models were accessed and management via the Marine Data Archive (MDA).

<!-- - *Question: TABLE with lat lon & names of receiver stations?* noooo right? -->

## Acoustic Tags

The *M. asterias* individuals were equipped with *Innovasea* ADST-V13TP tags (Innovasea Ltd., Boston, MA, USA), measuring 46 mm in length and weighing 13 g. Each tag had an estimated battery lifetime of 518 days, and contained a pressure and a temperature sensor with logging intervals of 120 s and 240 s, respectively. For each acoustic detection, a pressure or temperature value was transmitted with a ratio of 1:3 (pressure:temperature). Further details about the tags can be found in the Supporting Information of @goossens_2023.
<!-- reference to innovasea product manual -->
The pressure sensors recorded with a resolution of 0.3m and an accuracy of $\pm$ 3.4m until the depth of 68m, according to the manufacturer (**ref**).

## Tagging Procedure

```{r sum-tagging}
tagging_info <- masterias_info %>% mutate(date = release_date_time %>% lubridate::date(),                        release_loc = ifelse(release_latitude > 51.53, "Neeltje Jans", "outside WS")) %>% group_by(date) %>% reframe(n = n(), release_loc = release_loc %>% unique()) %>% mutate(date2 = date %>% format(format = "%B %d"))

# tagging_info %>% View()
```

Tagged animals were both caught and released in two locations, just west of *Neeltje Jans* (all individuals tagged in July, both 2018 and 2019), and outside the mouth of the Western Scheldt (all individuals tagged in August 2018). The tagging locations are listed in @tbl-releaseloc.
<!-- The two locations are shown in @fig-map_detail. -->

```{r prepare-releaseloc}
release_locations  <- release_locations  %>% 
  rename(`release location` = release_loc,
         `latitude` = lat,
         `longitude` = lng)
```


```{r table-animalinfo}
#| include: true
#| label: tbl-releaseloc
#| out-width: 90%
#| tbl-cap-location: top
#| tbl-cap: "Tagging locations. All sharks were tagged within a radius of 2 km of the tagging locations."

knitr::kable(release_locations) %>% kableExtra::kable_styling(position = "center", latex_options = "hold_position")
```



Animals were caught using line fishing or handline. After capture, each animal was placed in a holding tank filled with sea water. Before the surgery the animals were turned with the ventral side facing upwards to induce tonic immobility [@kessel_2015] and the midventral line was incised 2-3 cm with a scalpel. Next, the Acoustic Data Storage Tag was inserted into the abdominal cavity with forceps, and the incision was closed with 2-3 stitches of non-absorbable mono-filament [@goossens_2023].

<!-- <!-- Photo of tagging?? PJV? --> 

## Ethics statement

The care and use of the 30 *M. asterias* individuals complied with the Belgian Animal Welfare Act,
guidelines and policies as approved by the *Ethische Commissie Dierproeven* (project
reference EC2017-080). All animal treatments were undertaken in 2018 and 2019, and all tagging procedures were carried out by competent and trained personal license holders.

##	Data Analysis and visualisation

All data analyses were carried out using R [@R_2022], primarily using the packages *'dplyr'* and *'lubridate'*. All maps were created using the *'leaflet'*-package. Geospatial data, where not otherwise indicated, was queried from *marineregions.org* in the case of (marine) boundaries (with the *'mregions2'*-package), and *EMODnet* for human activities data (with the *'EMODnetWFS'*-package). All plots were generated using the *'ggplot2'*-package. Packages used for specific data analyses are indicated in the respective section.
<!-- To Do: name all required packages for an analysis -->

###	Acoustic Detections

Detections were accessed from the ETN database. Tags with only a single detection were omitted from all further analyses.
Summary statistics describing seasonal shark presence around the receivers in the Western Scheldt were calculated: The number of detections and individuals detected at each receiver, per month (*rephrase*).

<!-- **write: depth use ** -->

<!-- *To compare shark presence around the receivers in the Western Scheldt between seasons, an ANOVA was executed. (**TO DO**)*. -->

####	Vertical space use analysis

To assess the vertical space use of sharks detected in the WS 1 array, the depths transmitted with the detections were compared to the bathymetry composition around each receiver. A bathymetry dataset from the Flemish government (publication date: November 18, 2019) was used. The dataset had a 1m x 1m resolution and contains the mean depth per grid cell. The seafloor depth within a radius of 200 m around each receiver was extracted using the *'sf'*-package in R. The 200 m refer to the probability of >70% of an acoustic detection [@reubens_2019].
The following was done both for the bathymetry subsets and the acoustic detections for each receiver station in the WS1 array: Firstly, the maximum and minimum depth (of seafloor depth and acoustic detections) around each receiver were extracted, and the percentage of grid cells/detections that contained a depth value within a 10 m depth bin (spanning from 0 m to -50 m) was computed.


<!-- make reference to dataset: https://madame.vlaanderen.be/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/718dc576-7ddc-43b5-b71e-3bd3617e1bd3 -->


###	Data Storage Tags {#sec-mm_dsts}

Depth and temperature logs from the recovered tags were accessed via the Marine Data Archive (MDA).
<!-- TODO: link URL -->
The temperature log was not included in any analysis.
The first week of depth values was excluded from all analyses, to remove potential bias resulting from the tagging procedure [cf. @flavio_2021]. The date of death, used to calculate the time at liberty, was visually extracted from plots of the raw depth series, and marks the date after which only a tidal signal remains in the depthlog, which is characterised by cyclically rising and falling depths within a rough 2m interval.
<!-- Potentially automate this -->

Only depthlogs that logged for $\geq$ 365 days where included in the migration period analyses described below. Those will be referred to as *long term DST depthlogs* in the following.
<!-- maybe rephrase: "excluded from all analyses" -->
Summary statistics (median (since depth did not follow a normal distribution), maximum, minimum depth, and depth range) were calculated per hour, day/night, date, week and month. 
<!-- For all of these calculated summary statistics, the daily change was computed (i.e. * variable~change~ = variable~t~ - variable~t-1~).  -->
For the day/night summaries, sunrise and sunset times were extracted using the *'suncalc'*-package.
<!-- On the daily summaries, a rolling mean with a window size of 3 days was applied to smooth the data. -->
On the daily summaries a Savitzky-Golay smoothing filter [@press_1990, filter order *p = 1*, filter length *n = 5*] was applied using the *'sgolayfilt()'*-function from the *'signal'*-package. This particular filter smoothes the data but retains spikes in the data better than other smoothing filters like butterworth or averaging filters (like rolling mean) 
*(**ref**, example in `sgolayfilt()` documentation)*.
**Prior to spectral analyses, the data was centred and normalised, resulting in a mean of 0 and a sd of 1.**
<!-- check: sollte ich das noch machen?? -->
<!-- The animal's vertical speed (in *m/min*) was calculated following @griffiths_2020, dividing the depth difference between two consecutive measurements by the time interval (in min). -->


A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was performed on all DST logs
<!-- the raw longterm DST depthlogs -->
, using the *'base::fft()'*-function. This method decomposes a signal in the time domain (which is a combination of multiple sine waves with different frequencies) into its components in the frequency domain. Dominant frequencies (or rather periods, which is the inverse of the frequency) give insights about the scale of periodicity of a signal (in the present case the signal is the depth-timeseries) (*ref*).
<!-- give fft source -->


#### Migration Period Analysis {#sec-mm_migration}

<!-- **To do: remove rolling mean but instead use sgolay filter for all, p = 1 and n = 5** -->
The following steps were only performed on the longterm DST logs, that is, tag 1293308 and 1293321.

<!-- include function settings for CWT: dt = 1, factor_smallest_scale = 2) -->

Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) was performed on the daily summary statistics of the longterm DST depthlogs, using the *'biwavelet'*-package. In contrast to FFT, this method gives insights into the occurrence of certain frequencies within the time domain. Thus, not only information about the dominant frequencies is gathered, but also when in the time signal those frequencies appear. In order to resolve the components of the frequency domain within the time domain, however, the resolution of both is minimised (following Heisenberg's uncertainty principle). To obtain robust and valid results despite the resolution loss, frequencies were compared against white noise using a $\chi^2$ test. Only frequencies that significantly differed from white noise were incorporated into further analyses (**CWT reference**).
<!-- For the present study, a basic version of BCPA was applied to a vertical movement dataset from a demersal shark: Change Point Detection (CPD).  -->
Finally, daily summary statistics were used to detect abrupt changes in the depth time series, indicating the start of a migration phase. Following @aminikhanghahi_2017, *Relative unconstrained Least-Squares Importance Fitting* [RuLSIF, @liu_2013] is a robust method which is adequate to use with non-stationary (i.e., statistical properties such as the mean, or autocorrelation are non-constant over time) time series data like the dataset at hand. 
RuLSIF is a density-ratio estimation method and, in brief, approximates the dissimilarity of two subsequent time intervals $\chi$ and $\chi'$, using an $\alpha$*-relative Pearson Divergence* (rPE), with $0 < \alpha < 1$. By making the dissimilarity measure relative, the risk of infinite density ratios is circumvented [@liu_2013].

RuLSIF was employed with the *'ts_detect()'*-function from the *'rulsif.ts'*-package [@brubaker_2021]. The algorithm can take an n-dimensional time series as input, as such allowing for more than one calculated summary statistic to be used as input. In this case, the Savitzky-Golay-filtered (see @sec-mm_dsts) daily median depth, maximum and minimum were chosen. These three parameters describe the daily depth use in a basic but overseeable way, making the interpretation of results easier.

Hyperparameters are non-learned settings of a machine learning algorithm that control the learning behaviour during the algorithm's training [@yang_2020].
Several hyperparameters needed to be chosen: the relative parameter $\alpha$, the window size *w*, the number of samples before and after a data point to compare between (*step*), and the threshold of the relative PE score above which a time point is classified as a change point (*thresh*).
Hyperparameters were either chosen based on already established settings (here, $\alpha$ was kept at the function's default of 0.05) of the RuLSIF algorithm, based on ecological properties of the dataset (*w* = 7, because roughly one week long migrations were expected), or logical reasoning (*thresh = 0.95*, higher than the default 0.9, thus requiring the divergence measure (the rPE score) to be relatively high for a point to be classified as a change point). 
As default in *`ts_detect()`*, *step* is set to 10% of the amount of time points in the dataset used, but it is advised to decrease the step if computational resources allow for it [since smaller steps increase computation time, @brubaker_2021]. In the present study, RuLSIF was performed for different values of *step*: 2.5%, 5% and 10% of the input dataset length. For example, the DST 321 logged for 471 days, and a *step* of 5% of the input dataset length would amount to a *step* of 24 (days, rounded to the nearest integer).
To group detected change points into change periods, change points that were less than 7 days apart from each other were classified as the same change period.


<!-- Thirdly, the daily summary statistics and the results from the wavelet analysis (i.e., significantly present periods per day), were used as input for k-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. Unsupervised (as opposed to supervised) learning was utilised in this case because it does not require a training dataset with known right answers (which in this case would be the days that the sharks are migrating). -->
<!-- The algorithm was run n = 100 (**DO!**) times each for a number of clusters from 1 to 8. The optimal number of clusters was identified using the *elbow*-method (**reference**). -->

<!-- Next, FFT was performed on each cluster separately, after the predominant cluster per week was assigned to all data points within that week. The last step was done to smooth the clustering result and reclassify potential outliers. -->
<!-- In addition, CWT was performed on the hourly summary statistics for each cluster. -->

<!-- ##### Comparison to geolocation model output -->

## Acoustic detections

Two tags only had a single detection (serial number `r tag_serial_number_omit[1,] %>% dplyr::pull()` and `r tag_serial_number_omit[2,] %>% dplyr::pull()`) and were thus omitted from all further analyses.
The acoustic detections of each tag are showh in @fig-abacus.

## Data Storage Tags {#sec-results-dst}

Upon writing of this thesis, nine tags were recovered, one of which still is with at the manufacturer to extract the raw data. Information about the tags with available raw data is listed in @tbl-dstsum.

```{r prepare-dstsummary}

dst_summary <- dst_summary %>% relocate(sex, .after = tag_serial_number)  %>% rename(`tag serial nr.` = tag_serial_number, `release date` = release_date, `death date` = death_date, `days at liberty` = time_at_liberty, `tag recapture date` = recapture_date_time)

### Raw depth and temperature logs

The depth log of tag 295 is shown in @fig-dst295. The depth logs of the two long term DST are shown in @fig-dst308 and @fig-dst321. The remaining depth logs are depicted in the Annex (*ref to annex*).

### Summary statistics {#sec-results-dst-summary}

<!-- Noch ueberlegen wie ich das mit den Plots mache, weil ich gern alle 4 plots in einer figure vereinen wuerde -->

The daily summary statistics of the depthlogs of tags 308 and 321 are displayed in @fig-dstsum308 and in @fig-dstsum321.
The black line shows the daily median (not the mean since depth values are not normally distributed) with a rolling mean of 3 days. The grey ribbon spans between the daily maximum and minimum depth. The purple curve shows the change of daily median depth. The coloured bars represent the vertical movement behaviour per day as classified by a chi square test that compares the depths at night to the depths during the day.(depth (night) significantly shallower/deeper than depth (day): Diel Vertical Migration (DVM)/reverse DVM (rDVM), no significant difference: no DVM (nDVM)).

# Discussion

- relate the DVM to change periods: can patterns be observed?
<!-- Discuss working hypotheses, critical analysis of the interpretation of the data, compared to the available literature -->

##	Seasonality of starry smooth-hound presence
in/around westerschelde, according to ac. detections

-	Highly seasonal (only in summer)
    Explanation: Abiotic water conditions (salinity and temperature) are often evoked as controls for seasonal patterns of species occurrence ( Thiel et al ., 1995 ), from @maes_1998
-	Sex-biased (mostly females)
-	Possible pupping area, but this dataset not sufficient to confirm

### Vertical space use analysis

The results show deeper waters utilised by *M. asterias* around a receiver than contained in the bathymetry grid used. This can have several reasons:
1. The depth per grid cell is the mean depth in that cell, thus deeper depths are present most likely.
2. The shark was detected within a radius more than 200m away from the receiver, where the water is deeper.
3. The bathymetry grid does not match the actual conditions in the water at the time of detection, both due to the resolution of the grid and the highly dynamic, sandy environment with high possibility of changing depths.

##	Tag recoveries

### Tag sensitivity

2% - 5% tag to body weight ratio. study by brown and japsen (or sth), eels and cyprinid are more robust --> pieterjan, here ratio max 1.4% so from the study's point of view, the sharks should it have taken alright

**effect: as soon as you do any observation on animals, you interfere with the system
 that means: all tagging has an effect** discuss

###	Possible death reasons of short term dst’s

-	Tagging consequences
-	High sensitivity (verhelst, pers. Comm.)
-	Not likely: death bc of seals (no temp increase)
-	Laying dead on seafloor (tidal signal)

##	Ecological inferences from migration dataset analysis

- intensity of dial patterns in different periods for tag 308 and 321
  - e.g. periods of 6 and 12 h stronger present in 308 than 321: what could that mean? different foraging strategy or diet? Literature on sex-specific diet?

###	Vertical patterns during migration

-	Yes, but eventually swimming inshore
-	How strong are diel patterns in putative migration weeks? Check wavelet median depth

## Reflection on the analysis methods used

### Autocorrelation

Autocorrelation is a very basic exploratory analysis method used, amongst others, to determine the scale of patterns in time series data. In the present study an annual pattern could be seen, as both for tag 308 and 321 the autocorrelation reached a local maximum at a lag of around 350 days. (*get exact lag and reference figures*) Going further, the minimum of the autocorrelation occurs in winter. 
Thus, autocorrelation is a useful method to check if the assumptions about general vertical patterns (in the present case, the same vertical behaviour (resulting in a local autocorrelation maximum) every summer and a different behaviour (resulting in a local minimum) in winter). Potentially interesting are the points at which the autocorrelation is 0. This is the case at a lag (*insert exact lags and dates here*). It might be indicative of a behavioural switch. But this would only hold true in the case of behaviours that can be distinguishable from the depthlog. While it might not be the most resultful exploratory analysis it can be a helpful auxiliary tool to 1) explore the depth time series data and 2) potentially confirm identified periods with occurring behavioural switches.

##	Limits of biologging/ fish tagging

-	Geolocation modelling already leads to impressive results for comparatively well-studied species (e.g. cod (?), sea bass), but still limited in accuracy for not wellknown species

###	Limits of geolocation modelling

-	Boundary condition: max depth of fish per day == max depth of bathy for that day
-	Behavioural switch: migration/non-migration or migration/winter resident/summer resident

-	Resolution of bathymetry dataset
  -	Possible that shark was in certain area but bc bathymetry grid = summary (e.g. mean), geolocation model rules this location out (cf Woillez 2016)
-	Behaviour incorrectly/not inferred
  -	E.g. active vs inactive behaviour:
  
- talk about the geolocation model of @goossens_2023 and its limits?
  - there is one datapoint per day, masking daily location changes. 
  - knowing that M. asterias spends all its life on the seafloor, the maximum depth in the depthlog should not be shallower than the depth of the location for this day, since the opposite would imply that the animal swam in the water column
  - it most likely exhibits a somewhat residential behaviour with small horizontal movement during both summer and winter, and migratory behaviour for a short period
  
- argue how the geolocation model could overall be improved

### current state of fish tagging

-	It’s kind of the best we can do today, but non-satellite tagging methodologies have huge drawbacks still
-	Acoustic telemetry: high resolution on regional scale (i.e. where the receivers are placed) but outside of receiver networks: no knowledge at all

##	Limits of the chosen analysis methods

-	Wavelet analysis: no super fine scale analysis possible bc of limited res in both time and freq domain

##	Limits of the acoustic detection dataset

-	There are ~10 000 detections within ~2 yrs but compared to other studies (ref to other studies!) this is not that much.
-	the horiz resolution of receivers, esp in/around the WS is not good bc rather receiver gate than array to monitor species swimming into/out of the Scheldt river (= different use case scenario: receiver array needed to resolve locations of sharks better, and to e.g. enable triangulation)

##	Limits of the data storage tag dataset

-	Female shark: deeper than tag depth limit (68m): geolocation model inaccurate, shark putatively went into the Hurd deep (MRGID: 3321) in English channel
-	Only one individual per sex: not reliable, no statistics possible

# Conclusion

*brief summary of the main findings (original data, lesson learned,…)*

-	Possible improvements of tagging procedure (correct place here?)

# Outlook

*Alle kapitel aus der Einleitung wieder aufnehmen*

##	Acoustic detections additional analyses
-	Vertical space use: resolve individuals to see if there are differences between ind. Sharks
##	Improvements of geolocation model for M. asterias
- redo geolocation model with suggested changes and behavioural states
##	Information tool
- make into interactive application (RShiny) and do tests with some of the target groups to understand how well the information is taken in

- using the CWT outputs to segment the time series into different behaviours, like @soleymani_2017
