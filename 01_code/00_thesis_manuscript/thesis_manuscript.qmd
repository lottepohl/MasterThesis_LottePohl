<!-- # Questions to Jan, Niels and Carlota {#sec-questions} -->

<!-- ## active or passive writing -->

<!-- active or passive style of writing? I learned to write passively but I -->
<!-- see a lot of active writing in literature (i.e. we did this instead of -->
<!-- this was done) -->

<!-- ## how to include geolocation model output {#sec-questiongeolocation} -->

<!-- how should I include the geolocation model output of tag 308 and 321? It -->
<!-- is not sth that I did, so it should not go in my results. Thus, intro? -->
<!-- and how? It would be nice to show a map and underneath the raw depth- -->
<!-- and temperature log. But these logs are kind of a result, and I want to -->
<!-- put the raw plots in my results section to build up on that. But then I -->
<!-- have sth similar both in the intro and the results? I cannot do that.. -->

<!-- ## results structure {#sec_questionresultstructure} -->

<!-- How do I structure my results best? I am indecisive between making 1 big -->
<!-- figure per tag containing the raw depth and temp log, the -->
<!-- autocorrelation plot, the fft periodogram and the daily summary -->
<!-- statistics&vertical movement. In my eyes, this makes the most sense -->
<!-- since then you have all result plots at once for each tag, but it also -->
<!-- is a lot of information and might be overwhelming. The alternative would -->
<!-- be to make subchapters for `daily summaries`, `fft`, `raw depthlogs` etc -->
<!-- and plot all plots from the same category for each tag. What do you -->
<!-- think would be best? -->

<!-- ## study area definition {#sec-questionstudyarea} -->

<!-- I have trouble defining the study area: is the study area the BPNS and -->
<!-- the Scheldt, because there sharks were tagged? What are the greater -->
<!-- north sea and the english channel for the study, as sharks putatively -->
<!-- moved there during migration? I find it important to introduce those -->
<!-- habitats as well, because in the discussion I want to talk about food -->
<!-- availability and living conditions in the english channel & northern -->
<!-- north sea to relate to the putative migration paths. But it also gets -->
<!-- long in the methods to describe all 4 areas: the BPNS, the Scheldt -->
<!-- Estuary -->

<!-- ## linear model -->

<!-- Do you think that a linear model trying to relate daily summary statistics to identified migration behaviour could make sense. Having the behavioural state (migratory/resident) as dependent variable, and then trying daily median/max/min, but also the vertical migration behaviour, the most prominent periods and maybe even things like the temperature range as independent variables? -->

<!-- ## working hypotheses {#sec-questionshypotheses} -->

<!-- (How) should I include working hypotheses? -->

<!-- I feel like the structure of the data does not really allow for hypotheses to be made, but maybe I am too cautious. In @sec-introaims I try to define some hypotheses but please let me know if this makes sense at all or not. -->

<!-- ## maps {#sec-questionsmaps} -->

<!-- I know that I need to improve my maps and make them more readable and -->
<!-- understandable. I think I will do my maps in ggplot as opposed to use -->
<!-- leaflet. Besides the *To Dos* that I have listed in @sec-mmscheldtBPNS, -->
<!-- what would you put in/leave out of the maps? -->

<!-- ## acoustic detections analyses {#sec-questionacousticanalyses} -->

<!-- I'm not sure yet which calculations I will include yet. Maybe something -->
<!-- concerned with monthly summary statistics. But maybe this also is too -->
<!-- much and I should just put the vertical space use analysis and leave out -->
<!-- the rest. With the rest I mean things I show here: -->
<!-- (https://lottepohl.github.io/thesis_docs/20230227_acoustic_data_month_sex/). -->
<!-- Maybe though I can try and do a simple ANOVA to compare number of -->
<!-- detections per sex and month, for example. What are your ideas? -->


<!-- ## Markdown syntax {-} -->

<!-- Here is some normal text, and then we'll use the \mycommand{custom command} to make this text bold. Also, this is a reference test @dodge_2013. And to combine references, we can use this [@nathan_2008; @dodge_2013]. -->

The starry smooth-hound Mustelus asterias (Cloquet, 1819) is a widely distributed demersal shark in the Northeast Atlantic, yet under increasing fishing pressure. To lay the grounds for future species management plans, information on its complex annual migration and residency behaviour is needed. 
The movement of fish is commonly studied with electronic tags. A novel technology is the Acoustic Data Storage Tag (ADST), which can be detected by acoustic receivers and additionally logs temperature and water depth in predefined intervals. To access the data logs the tag needs to be recovered.
This study employed ADST to characterise the migration and residency of M. asterias in the North Sea regarding seasonality and sex.
Exploratory and spectral analyses were performed using an ADST dataset spanning from July 2018 to July 2020. 

In 2018 and 2019, 30 adult M. asterias (19 females, 11 males) were equipped with ADST-V13TP (Innovasea, 518 days estimated battery life) in the Scheldt Estuary. The Permanent Belgian Receiver Network (PBARN) spans the Belgian Part of the North Sea (BPNS) and the Scheldt Estuary with 160 active receivers during the study period. 14 females and 4 males were detected 10940 times by 27 acoustic receivers. 
All detections were between April and November, suggesting seasonal presence of M. asterias in the receiver area. 96.7% of detections were at receivers just outside the Western Scheldt, and 97.4% of detections were from females. This indicates that the outer part of the Scheldt Estuary is a relevant habitat for females between April and November.

8 ADST were recovered, one female and one male logging data for over a year. Both tags logged depths between 0 and 20 m between June and October, and depths between 10 and 75 m between October and June. The changing depth range reflects the migration of the sharks into deeper waters during winter months. Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) resolves periodic patterns in the time domain and displays differences in periodic patterns between seasons and the two individuals. The CWT results suggest that the female is resting during summer and feeding in a biweekly pattern in winter, and that the male is continuously feeding.

This study provides first details about seasonality in vertical movement behaviour of M. asterias and confirms its seasonal presence in the Western Scheldt. Data on the vertical movement of more individuals is needed to determine if the patterns observed here are related to sex.

The starry smooth-hound *Mustelus asterias* is widely distributed in the Northeast Atlantic, yet under increasing fishing pressure. To lay the grounds for future species management plans, information on its complex annual migration and residency behaviour is needed. 
Fish movement is commonly studied with electronic tags, one novel technology being  the Acoustic Data Storage Tag (ADST). It can be detected by acoustic receivers and additionally logs temperature and water depth in predefined intervals.
This study characterises the migration and residency of *M. asterias* in the North Sea regarding season and sex. 30 *M. asterias* were equipped with ADST in the Scheldt Estuary in 2018 and 2019. 
Acoustic detections of 18 individuals in the Western Scheldt estuary between July 2018 and July 2020 suggest seasonal presence of females just outside of the Western Scheldt between April and October.
Spectral analysis of the depth logs of two individuals logging for over a year indicates feeding behaviour of the male throughout most of the year. The female shark primarily rests on the seafloor during summer and feeds in a biweekly rhythm during winter.
This study presents the first detailed insights into vertical movement behaviour differences between seasons and individuals of *M. asterias*.


# Introduction {#sec-intro}

Gathering knowledge on migratory fish species with complex life cycles
is challenging, yet necessary to improve management of such species in
the future [@brownscombe_2022]. Fish with late reproduction and low
offspring numbers such as elasmobranchs are especially vulnerable to
anthropogenic effects and require special attention [@stevens_2000].

<!-- ***problem statement: migratory fish, large migrations, management and conservation needed, sharks especially vulnerable, lead to M. asterias.*** -->

An elasmobranch with a complex life cycle involving biannual
reproduction and a sex-specific annual migration is the starry
smooth-hound *Mustelus asterias* (Cloquet, 1819), a demersal
triakid shark widely distributed in the Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea [@breve_2016; @griffiths_2020]. In the past decade, both commercial landings [@ices_2022; @bitonporsmoguer_2022] and abundance in the North Sea [@mccullyphillips_2015] have increased. The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) classified the species to be *Near Threatened* [@ices_2022].
<!-- have shifted from the -->
<!-- recently protected *Squalus acanthias* to *M. asterias* [@ices_2022; @bitonporsmoguer_2022], but also abundance in the North Sea has increased [@mccullyphillips_2015]. -->
<!-- [@ices_2022, status: *Near Threatened*]. -->
Meanwhile, knowledge on the seasonal presence of *M. asterias* in the North Sea, especially in Belgian Part of the North Sea (BPNS) and the estuary of the
Western Scheldt is missing. 
<!-- In Dutch coastal waters, for instance, the species was rarely caught until 2009, and @breve_2016 hypothesises that *M. asterias* increasingly uses the Scheldt estuary as a summer habitat because of shifting environmental conditions resulting from climate change. -->
Tracking the movement and presence of migratory aquatic species in space and time, however, requires advanced technologies which have improved substantially in recent years
[@whoriskey_2019].

<!-- (i.e., change of pH, eutrophication and differing water temperatures). -->

<!-- **say sth about that we need a species management plan but for that we need to gather more info on movement** -->

<!-- [^1]: Verhelst, Pieterjan (*personal communication*), April 25, 2023. -->

<!-- o  Until recently, close to nothing about the seasonal presence of M. asterias in the Belgian Part of the North Sea and especially the Scheldt Estuary was known -->

<!-- o  But catches are increasing, alongside the species’ commervial value (Griffiths et al., 2002 and ICES, 2017) -->
<!-- o  Advanced technology is required to follow the movements of demersal, migratory species (transition to telemetry and ADST)  -->
<!-- Insights into the distribution of aquatic species are possible via  -->

## Aquatic telemetry

<!-- ***Overview of the field of acoustic telemetry, popular methods and the resulting dataset structure*** -->

Telemetry refers to the remote monitoring of animals using electronic
transmitters or tags, and receivers [@whoriskey_2019], allowing for the
tracking of marine animal movement. A multitude of telemetry methods
exists today, popular technologies to study aquatic animals include
acoustic telemetry and archival telemetry [@thorstad_2013]. 
Telemetry furthermore enables the quantification of animal migrations and (vertical and horizontal) habitat use [@hussey_2015], which informs species management and conservation spanning marine, freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems [@beger_2010].

<!-- Satellite telemetry involves satellites that receive signals from a tag attached to animal, requiring the tag to breach the water surface for signal transmission (**ref**). -->

Acoustic telemetry refers to the use of acoustic receivers that are
placed in the water column. These can detect acoustic signals emitted
from a tag within a certain range. Such networks exist primarily in
shallow, coastal areas [@hussey_2015] such as 
<!-- of countries with sufficient financial resources -->
<!-- to maintain the receivers [@hussey_2015]. Examples include  -->
the Acoustic Tracking Array Platform (ATAP) in South Africa [@cowley_2017] and the Permanent Belgian Acoustic Receiver Network [PBARN, @reubens_2019].

<!-- maybe include: Recently,    a  shift    from    mobile  tracking    towards     using   fixed   receiving  stations    that    automatically   log detections  has led to  a   large   number   of tagged  animals and extensive   receiver    coverage    crossing    geopolitical    boundaries   (Donaldson  et al.,    2014). from whoriskey 2017 -->

Archival telemetry uses tags or biologgers that record and locally store water pressure, temperature and other environmental
variables. Popup Satellite Archival Tags (PSAT) disattach from the
animal and float to the surface, transmitting recorded data to
satellites, while Data Storage Tags (DST) require the retrieval of the
tag for downloading data [@thorstad_2013].

Acoustic data storage tags (ADST) are a combination tag, merging
acoustic and data storage tags [@goossens_2023]. As such, the tag emits
unique acoustic signals that can be detected by an acoustic receiver
within a certain range, and additionally records water pressure and temperature in
predefined intervals.
<!-- The advantage of ADST lies in the combination of  --> ADST gather
data on horizontal fish movement inside acoustic receiver networks while
simultaneously collecting fine-scale vertical movement data that can be
used to infer movement of the fish beyond acoustic receiver arrays.
<!-- •  State advantage of ADST: gathering knowledge on horizontal movement within areas of acoustic receiver array, and additionally gaining fine-scale data beyond those receiver areas to investigate movement and migrations outside the receiver areas -->

Different telemetry methods result in different datasets. In acoustic
telemetry, recorded data contains the time that a specific tag was
detected by a specific receiver (with a known location).
<!-- , resulting in an irregular time series (i.e., a time series with irregularly spaced observations).  -->
These datasets come in a horizontal dimension, i.e., with
a latitude and longitude position.
Archival telemetry (using DST, for example) generates regular time series in pre-defined
intervals, logging water depth and other
environmental variables. These data come in a vertical dimension,
spanning the range of the animal's depth use.
ADST datasets contain time stamps of the tag's detection at a specific
acoustic receiver, and, in case the tag was recovered, logs of water
depth and other environmental variables.

<!-- ###    Geolocation modelling -->

<!-- ***see @sec-questiongeolocation.*** -->

To infer the latitude and longitude (i.e., the horizontal dimension) of a DST log (which is in a vertical dimension), stochastic geolocation models are used [@gatti_2021]. These models use the seafloor bathymetry in
combination with other environmental variables such as water temperature to
estimate the most likely path that was taken by the animal
[@nielsen_2004; @gatti_2021]. Common geolocation modelling approaches use Hidden Markov Models [HMM, @pedersen_2008; @woillez_2016]. For certain species with high economic importance (Atlantic cod *Gadus morhua* and European seabass *Dicentrarchus labrax*, for example), those models have been improved by including different behavioural states of the animals [@pedersen_2008; @heerah_2017]. Behavioural states (such as low or high activity) are driven by the animal's environment and internal ecophysiological processes [@gurarie_2016]. Geolocation modelling has been employed for *M. asterias* with the implementation of behavioural states [following the approach by @pedersen_2008] and without [@goossens_2023]. Geolocation model outputs for one female and one male *M. asterias* are shown in @fig-mapgeolocation.

<!-- @pedersen_2008 introduced a geolocation model for a demersal fish -->
<!-- species using Hidden Markov Models (HMM), which was refined by -->
<!-- @woillez_2016. This model framework was applied to DST data from *M. -->
<!-- asterias* individuals [see @goossens_2023, the geolocation results for -->
<!-- one female and one male shark are shown in @fig-mapgeolocation]. -->
<!-- The method by @woillez_2016 involves a HMM with two sub-models  an observation and a behavioural model. -->

<!-- ##### Geolocation Model Results -->

<!-- @goossens_2023 used a geolocation model approach with a two-state HMM following the geolocation approach by @woillez_2016. The inferred daily locations of two *M. asterias* individuals tagged in 2018 are shown in @fig-mapgeolocation. -->

## The starry smooth-hound shark *Mustelus asterias*


The starry smooth-hound shark (*Mustelus asterias*, Family: Triakidae)
inhabits waters of the Northeast Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea,
stretching from the Irish Sea and Northern North Sea in the North, to an
unknown limit in the south [@ices_2022]. 
<!-- @farrell_2009 confirmed *M. asterias* as the -->
<!-- only occurring *Mustelus* species in the Northeast Atlantic following -->
<!-- decades of partial misidentification of *M. asterias* as the common -->
<!-- smooth-hound *Mustelus mustelus*, which occupies warmer waters in the -->
<!-- central eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea [@farrell_2015]. -->
The species measures around 30 cm in total length (TL) at birth, 100
cm (males) and 120 cm (females) when reaching sexual maturity
[@farrell_2010], and can attain up to 140 cm TL [@mccullyphillips_2015].
Sexual maturity is reached at 4-5 and 6 years of age for males and
females, respectively, and longevity is 13 years and 18 years for males
and females, respectively [@farrell_2010].
<!-- Decreasing trends in mean density over the period 1988 to 2008 were perceptible for  Raja montagui and Galeorhinus galeus , while increasing trends were apparent for  Scyliorhinus canicula ,  Scyliorhinus stellaris and Mustelus asterias . Given the taxonomic confusion between  Mustelus spp., a combined trend was also examined, which also indicated an increasing trend, although this trend was driven by  M. asterias , the more abundant of the two. Due to low catch rates over the duration of the surveys, further (i.e. quantitative) investigations into the significance of these observed temporal trends were not carried out. from Martin, C. S., Vaz, S., Ellis, J. R., Coppin, F., Le Roy, D., & Carpentier, A. (2010). Spatio-temporal patterns in demersal elasmobranchs from trawl surveys in the eastern English Channel (1988–2008). Marine Ecology Progress Series, 417, 211–228. -->
<!-- The relative abundance of M . asterias appears to have increased in the waters around the British Isles, as indicated by increasing catch rates in several fishery-independent surveys over the first decade of the 2000s, and increased reported landings by the commercial fleet (ICES, 2014). -->
<!-- from mccullyphilipps 2015 -->

<!-- ### Reproductive behaviour -->
<!-- *M. asterias* has a complex reproduction behaviour. -->
The species is matrotrophic aplacentally viviparous [i.e., embryos absorb
nutrients from a yolk sack that is used up during gestation, @farrell_2010a; @mccullyphillips_2015]. It furthmore displays polyandry (i.e., one female mating with several males within
one breeding season) and multiple paternity [i.e., pups within one
litter originate from several males, @farrell_2014]. Moreover, it has
a biannual reproduction cycle with a gestation period of about 12
months, followed by a 12-month resting period. *M. asterias* females can
store sperm for up to 12 months [@farrell_2010a]. The same study found
embryos from different developmental stages in gestating females (termed
embryo asynchronism). @griffiths_2020 reported philopatric behaviour
(i.e., females returning to the same area for parturition) for the first
time. Identified parturition grounds for *M. asterias* include the
estaury of the Eastern Scheldt and, more generally, the Bristol Channel, Southern North
Sea and the English Channel [@dureuil_2013; @mccullyphillips_2015;
@breve_2016]. Pupping possibly takes place between April and September
[@farrell_2010a; @mccullyphillips_2015].


<!-- ###    Feeding behaviou -->

<!-- IMAGE: starry smooth-hound -->
*M. asterias* is morphologically adapted to a demersal life style, exhibiting a ventrally located snout
that enables it to feed on prey on the
seafloor.
<!-- , indicating that it swims closely above the seafloor during -->
<!-- foraging and preying. -->
<!-- <!-- [^2]. --> 
<!--   [^2]: Brevé, Niels (*personal communication*), March 27, 2023. -->
It is a specialist feeder on benthic and suprabenthic
crustaceans [@mccullyphillips_2020; @bitonporsmoguer_2022]. Common prey include the hermit crab (*Pagurus bernhardus*),
the flying crab (*Liocarcinus holsatus*), the common shore crab
(*Carcinus maenas*) and the edible crab [*Cancer pagurus*, @mccullyphillips_2015; @mccullyphillips_2020]. Potential predators of
*M. asterias* are the grey seal (*Halichoerus grypus*) which occurs in
the North Sea, the blue shark (*Prionace glauca*) and the common dolphin
(*Delphinus delphis*), both of which occur in the Western English
Channel [@griffiths_2020].

<!-- - Feeding: crustaceans, swimming shorewards at night -->

<!-- - Daily horizontal distance: up to 70km (**ref!**) -->

<!-- ### Daily behaviour -->

<!-- - daily vertical migration: present (find source), but also (most likely) horizontal movement associated with the vertical movement, i.e. the animal stays on the seafloor and swims shorewards during the night, feeding on crustaceans (?) -->

*M. asterias* shows higher vertical activity during night than during
the day [@griffiths_2020]. This indicates foraging and preying behaviour at night,
a commonly observed behaviour in elasmobranchs [@sims_2006]. During the day, *M. asterias*
potentially avoids predation by resting on the seafloor [@griffiths_2020].
<!-- ### Migration -->
<!-- - 1 sentence about the potential of two populations in the greater north sea, and one population going into the Scheldt Estuary in summer [@breve_2016]. -->
The species displays annual, potentially sex-specific
migration.
<!-- [@breve_2016; @breve_2020; @griffiths_2020]. -->
<!-- Annual migration is part of the life cycle of adult *M. asterias*, -->
Females are thought to move into the English Channel and the Bay of
Biscay in winter, and males move into the Northern North Sea and into
the English Channel [@breve_2016; @breve_2020; @griffiths_2020].
@breve_2016 and @griffiths_2020 hypothesise that the *M. asterias* population in the Northeast Atlantic consists of two (or more) sub-populations that mix on
seasonal grounds.

<!-- Females are known to stay in and -->
<!-- around the Scheldt Estuary in summer months. The *M. asterias* -->
<!-- population in the Northeast Atlantic potentially consists of two (or -->
<!-- more) sub-populations [@breve_2016; @griffiths_2020] that mix on -->
<!-- seasonal grounds. -->
<!-- Potential reasons of this sex-specific migration are females avoiding -->
<!-- mating, resource competition, or reduction of embryo mortality -->
<!-- [@speed_2010]. -->

<!-- also found in other sharks, eg the tope shark (Colloca 2019, from breve 2020) -->

<!-- - Sex bias: Males into Northern North Sea, females into Bay of Biscay -->

<!-- From griffiths 2020: This uncertainty is mainly driven by species identification issues, as morphological similarities between -->

<!-- M. asterias and the common smooth-hound Mustelus mustelus (a separate species that occupies the warmer waters of the central eastern Atlantic, Mediterranean Sea [14, 15] and Black -->

<!-- Sea [16]) have confounded both fishery-independent trawl surveys and commercial catch data -->

<!-- [18]. This misidentification may have led to an over-estimation of the stock’s spatial range for much of the 20th century -->

## Aims of this work {#sec-intro-aims}

Detailed information on potential differences  in vertical movement regarding seasonality and sex, including the timing and duration of migrations, are currently missing. Such information can improve geolocation models through the implementation of behavioural states [@pedersen_2008]. Moreover, the seasonal presence of *M. asterias* in the Western Scheldt estuary, a presumed summer habitat of the species, has not been studied yet. The confirmation of seasonal presence of *M. asterias* would be relevant to species management. This could involve stock assessments or seasonal restrictions for commercial fishing  in the future [@benot_2003].

characterize the seasonal habitat use (vertical and horizontal) among sexes.

Considering these knowledge gaps, the present study aims to characterise the seasonal habitat use of *M. asterias* among sexes on a vertical and horizontal scale. Consequently, the study is structured into two points of focus:

<!-- aims to assess seasonal and sex-related differences in movement patterns of *M. asterias* with two different points of focus:  -->

 1. The presence of *M. asterias* in the Western Scheldt estuary.
  - Hypothesis: Females show higher residency in the area of the PBARN receivers than males.
 2. The vertical movement of *M. asterias* on an annual scale.
  - Hypothesis: The vertical movement differs between seasons for both males and females.
  
  
Due to its ability to collect and produce data in smaller and larger scales, Acoustic Data Storage Tags (ADST) are a suitable technology to assess these topics.
As such, an ADST dataset of *M. asterias* will be used to describe and characterise both focus points of this study, followed by the investigation of patterns linked to season and sex.

<!--  - Aim 1: Describe and characterise the presence of *M. asterias* in the Western Scheldt estuary, and determine patterns of presence linked to season and sex. -->
<!--  - Aim 2: Describe and characterise the annual vertical movement of *M. asterias* focusing on the following questions: -->
<!-- 1.	Are there seasonal differences in vertical behaviour? -->
<!-- 2.	Are there differences between sexes? -->


<!-- Knowledge gaps -->
<!-- •	Migration: Exact timing unknown, and vertical behaviour during migration unstudied, but relevant to assess to enable incorporation of different behavioural states into geolocation modelling -->
<!-- •	Role of the Western Scheldt in the reproductive cycle hypothesized to be relevant (e.g. since Eastern Scheldt is a confirmed pupping ground) but not studied yet -->

<!-- The sex bias in *M. asterias* migration behaviour and seasonal presence in the North Sea was investigated by @breve_2016 and @griffiths_2020, however, the vertical behaviour has not been assessed on a seasonal scale yet. Investigating the raw depth data from DST bears potential in revealing behavioural patterns (that potentially differ per season and sex). Such information can not only improve geolocation models but is also relevant for species management. The latter might include stock assessments or seasonal restrictions for commercial fishing to prevent overexploitation in the long term [@benot_2003]. -->

<!-- Moreover, the role of the Western Scheldt in the species’ reproductive life cycle is hypothesized to be relevant. The adjacent estuary of the Eastern Scheldt is a confirmed pupping ground, and both adult females and neonates have been reported in summer just outside of the Western Scheldt[^1]. -->
<!-- 	[^1]: Verhelst, Pieterjan (*personal communication*), April 25, 2023. -->
<!-- Until now, however, the seasonal presence of *M. asterias* in the Western Scheldt has not been studied. -->



<!-- ### Research gaps -->

<!-- #### Relevance of the Study -->

<!-- Seasonal presence and aggregations related to parturition have been reported in the Eastern Scheldt estuary [@breve_2016]. However, the importance of the Western Scheldt estuary for the species has, not been assessed yet. -->


<!-- @griffiths_2020 identified seabed association of *M. asterias* as a -->
<!-- research gap. @breve_2020 advised to further research *M. asterias* with -->
<!-- a combination of telemetry and genetic techniques. -->

<!-- #### Migration -->

<!-- -   sex bias known, but no exact locations, timing also unknown -->
<!-- -   Horizontal and vertical behaviour during migration -->
<!-- -  Until now, many capture/recapture studies, but no in-depth tracking studies (to our knowledge) -->

<!-- ####   Reproduction -->

<!-- -   reproductive habitats already studied to some extent, but e.g. -->
<!--     parturition site Western Scheldt unconfirmed -->
<!--     -   General details about parturition: all pups released at once, -->
<!--         batches? -->

<!-- ## Communication of fish movement ecology studies -->

<!-- *not sure if include at all or not* -->

<!-- ###    Problem -->

<!-- the data is complex and difficult to understand for non-experts, yet it is imperative to communicate the scientific results to transform them into action/change -->

<!-- ###    The quadruple helix -->

<!-- -  Communication from (fish) scientists to politicians to inform political and fishery management decisions -->

<!-- -  Creating awareness within the general public -->

<!-- -  Information of industry stakeholders, e.g. wind farm companies -->

<!-- ## Aims of the work {#sec-introaims} -->

<!--  *rewrite* --> 

<!-- The aims of this work are threefold. The first two aims involve DST -->
<!-- data, the third aim involves acoustic detections of *M. asterias*: -->

<!--  Problem here: how do I describe my aims before explaining how many sharks were tagged and how many tags we got back? -->

<!-- 1.  An ecological description and characterisation of the Data Storage -->
<!--     Tag data -->
<!-- 2.  The implementation of a simple method to detect behavioural switches -->
<!--     in the depthlogs of migrating *M. asterias* individuals, -->
<!--     contributing to the improvement of future geolocation modelling of -->
<!--     DST data -->
<!-- 3.  Description of the acoustic detections of *M. asterias* and the -->
<!--     assessment the vertical habitat use of female *M. asterias* just -->
<!--     outside of the Western Scheldt during summer. -->

<!-- Relevant research gaps on *M. asterias* involve the species' sex-biased migration routes and periods. Due to its benthic lifestyle, no satellite tags can be employed, requiring geolocation modelling of Data Storage Tags. Including behavioural states into a geolocation model increases its reliability.  -->

<!-- @goossens_2023 modelled DST data from *M. asterias* without behaviorual switches. The present study implements a simple method to detect change points in a time series signal in order to infer behavioural states from depth time series *M. asterias* that span $\geq$ 365 days. -->

<!-- ###    Characterizing the vertical behaviour (i.e. the depthlogs) of the migrating sharks -->

<!-- -  Motivation: provide additional input for geolocation models(Behavioural switches) -->

<!-- -  Implement unsupervised learning in the form of Change Point Detection to infer behavioural states/switches = test a new, simple way of inferring behavioural switches. -->

<!-- ### Working hypotheses -->

<!-- ***Not sure if I should include this at all, I feel like with this kind -->
<!-- of dataset it is tricky to state clear and falsifiable hypotheses. What -->
<!-- do you say? See @sec-questionshypotheses.*** -->

<!-- 1.  Using Change Point Detection on daily summary statistics -->
<!--     successfully identifies putative migration periods, as identified by -->
<!--     visual analysis of the raw depthlog. -->

<!-- ###    Exploratory and descriptive analysis of the female sharks’ vertical behaviour -->

<!-- in the Western Scheldt using the acoustic detections data -->

<!-- -  Sub-dataset of July 2019 since this has the highest density of acoustic detections (~6000 out of ~10000 total detections) -->

<!-- ####   Working hypothesis -->

<!-- 2.  During summer, sharks predominantly use the seafloor section of the -->
<!--     space around a receiver -->

<!-- -   predominantly = xx% (or result of chi2?) -->
<!-- -   seafloor section = the deepest 75% around a receiver -->

<!-- ####   Working hypotheses about the acoustic dataset in general -->

<!-- the seasonal presence of M. asterias is reflected in the acoustic detection dataset -->

<!-- 3.  Already established hypotheses about *M. asterias* behaviour are -->
<!--     reflected in the acoustic detections -->

<!-- -   seasonal presence in the Scheldt estuary (H0 = the mean \# -->
<!--     detections per month in summer months, here: March -- September -->
<!--     significantly differs from that in winter months (t-test or Levene -->
<!--     test)) -->
<!-- -   sex bias, i.e. that females are predominantly present in the Western -->
<!--     Scheldt (H0 = number of females detected per month significantly -->
<!--     differs from the number of males (t test)) -->

<!-- PLOT (maybe: boxplot, winter vs summer months, detections grouped into months) -->

<!-- the sex bias, i.e. that females are predominantly present in the WS, is reflected in the acoustic detections -->

<!-- -  H0 = number of females detected per month significantly differs from the number of males (t test) -->

<!-- ###    Converting the first results -->

<!-- into a format that transmit relevant messages to one/several groups of non-scientists -->

<!-- **Do not make into aim, too little done in the thesis ** -> move to outlook? -->

<!-- -  No working hypothesis, bc only concept and first draft version, but outlook: further development and then study with people about how well they understood the information provided -->

<!-- State that most of the analyses are descriptive/exploratory bc not much is known about the species yet and the dataset Is a bit too small to perform real statistical tests on -->

<!-- ## Acoustic Tags -->
<!-- Acoustic Data Storage Tags (ADST) were used for this study, -->
*Innovasea* ADST-V13TP tags (Innovasea Ltd., Boston, MA, USA) were used for this study, measuring 46 mm in length and weighing 13 g. Each tag had an estimated battery lifetime of 518 days,
and contained a pressure and a temperature sensor with logging intervals
of 120 s and 240 s, respectively. For each acoustic detection, a
pressure or temperature value was transmitted with a ratio of 1:3
(pressure:temperature). Further details about the tags can be found in
the Supporting Information of @goossens_2023.
<!-- reference to innovasea product manual --> The pressure sensors
recorded with a resolution of 0.3 m and an accuracy of $\pm$ 3.4 m until
the depth of 68 m, according to the manufacturer [@Innovasea_ADST].

## Tagging Procedure

```{r sum-tagging}
tagging_info <- masterias_info %>% mutate(date = release_date_time %>% lubridate::date(),                        release_loc = ifelse(release_latitude > 51.53, "Neeltje Jans", "outside WS")) %>% group_by(date) %>% reframe(n = n(), release_loc = release_loc %>% unique()) %>% mutate(date2 = date %>% format(format = "%B %d"))

# tagging_info %>% View()
```

Tagged animals were both caught and released in two locations, just west
of *Neeltje Jans* (all individuals tagged in July, both 2018 and 2019),
and outside the mouth of the Western Scheldt (all individuals tagged in
August 2018). The tagging locations are listed in @tbl-releaseloc.
<!-- The two locations are shown in @fig-map_detail. -->

```{r prepare-releaseloc}
release_locations  <- release_locations  %>% 
  rename(`release location` = release_loc,
         `Latitude` = lat,
         `Longitude` = lng)
```

knitr::kable(release_locations) %>% kableExtra::kable_styling(position = "center", latex_options = "HOLD_position")
```

Animals were caught using line fishing or handline. After capture, each
animal was placed in a holding tank filled with sea water. Before the
surgery the animals were turned with the ventral side facing upwards to
induce tonic immobility [@kessel_2015] and the midventral line was
incised 2-3 cm with a scalpel. Next, the Acoustic Data Storage Tag was
inserted into the abdominal cavity with forceps, and the incision was
closed with 2-3 stitches of non-absorbable mono-filament
[@goossens_2023]. Photos of the capture and tagging of *M. asterias* are shown in @fig-taggingpics.

## Study Area {#sec-mm_studyarea}

The points of focus of this work are twofold (@sec-intro-aims). Consequently, the study area encompasses two scales. The first point of focus focuses on the Belgian Part of the North Sea (BPNS) and the estuary of the Western Scheldt. The second focus point includes year-round behaviour and thus, the study area is more broad and less defined. Since the species is thought to move both into the English Channel and into the North Sea north of the BPNS, both regions constitute the study area for the second point of focus.

### The BPNS and Scheldt Estuary {#sec-mmscheldtBPNS}

The Belgian Part of the North Sea (BPNS) is generally characterised by
shallow water depths below 40 m [@thierry_2019], sandy or muddy sediment
[@wolff_1973; @vasquez_2021] and multiple sandbanks and troughs.
<!-- Artificial structures resulting from human activities, such as -->
<!-- shipwrecks and Offshore Wind Farms (OWF), provide hard substrate. Apart -->
<!-- from seafaring and energy production, shipping, fishing (including -->
<!-- trawling) or sand and gravel extraction take place in the BPNS -->
<!-- [@chen_2005; @douvere_2007]. Furthermore, submarine cables to facilitate -->
<!-- energy transport and telecommunication have been present in the North -->
<!-- Sea for decades [@degroot_1979].  -->
The river Scheldt meets the North Sea
north of the border between the Netherlands and Belgium, forming an
Estuary with a complex regime of sandflats and channels
[@claessens_1988]. Both the BPNS and the Scheldt Estuary are highly
mixed due to strong currents and tides [@otto_1990], introducing saline
waters well into the Scheldt Estuary [@ouboter_1998]. The Scheldt
Estuary is characterised by medium to coarse sand and salinity between
ranges 2 and 33.5 ppt [@baeyens_1998], peaking in summer [@maes_1998].
The seafloor depth averages around 11 m with occasional troughs of up to
20 or 30 m [@thierry_2019]. The BPNS and the Scheldt Estuary are
influenced by two water bodies: The Channel water and the
Continental coastal water, meeting about 30 km off the Belgian coast [@wolff_1973]. The former is characterised by high salinity
(\> 18 ppt), low nutrient levels and water temperatures ranging between
6 °C in winter to 16°C in summer. The latter has a lower salinity, has
high nutrient levels and a larger temperature range than the Channel
water averaging between 3°C in winter and 17°C in summer.
An overview map of the BPNS and the Scheldt
Estuary is provided in @fig-mapdetail. Fish and crustacean species
composition and abundance underlies strong seasonal patterns, peaking in
summer [@maes_1998; @maes_2005]. Seasonally occuring species are marine
fish like Atlantic herring (*Clupea harengus*), Sprat (*Sprattus
sprattus*) or Whiting (*Merlangius merlangus*), and abundant crustacean
species include the common shrimp (*Crangon crangon*) and the palaemonid
shrimp [*Palaemon varians*, @maes_1998].
The lower part of the Scheldt Estuary from Flushing (Dutch: Vlissingen)
55-60 km upstream is referred to as Western Scheldt
Estuary[@baeyens_1998; @ouboter_1998]. Between Bergen op Zoom and the
island Neeltje Jans (both Netherlands), the Estuary is referred to as
the Eastern Scheldt Estuary. 

### The East Anglian coast

The east Anglian coast lies within the Southern North Sea and is characterised by shallow coastal waters between 20 and 25 m water depth, fast tidal streams and sandy and muddy seafloor sediments [@harrison_1990]. 
Tidal currents are strongest at 1.3 $\frac{m}{s}$ during new and full moon [@arnold_1994]. Abundant crustacea include *Hyas coarctatus* [@dyer_1985], *Pandalus montagui*, *Carcinus spp.* and *Eupagurus spp.* [@sergeant_1951].

### The English channel {#sec-mmstudyareaec}

The English Channel (EC) extends from the Dover Strait to England's
southwestern tip, spanning 77 000 km^2^ [@dauvin_2012]. The mean
seafloor depth increases from around 25 m in the east to 75 m in the
west [@dauvin_2012], except for the 174 m deep *Hurd deep*, a trench
located close to the channel island Guernsey. An overview of the English
Channel and the North Sea is provided in @fig-mapoverview.
Shipping,
<!-- fishing and granulate extraction occurs all over the EC region -->
<!-- [@dauvin_2015].  -->
Strong tidal currents from west to east are present,
which are higher on the French than on the English coast due to Coriolis
force, reaching maximum values of 4 $\frac{m}{s}$ at the Cap de la Hague
[@salomon_1993].
<!-- Tidal circulation influences the composition of -->
<!-- superficial seafloor sediments with coarse sediments dominating in areas -->
<!-- of strong tidal currents and fine and muddy sediments dominating in bays -->
<!-- and estuaries with weaker tidal currents as well as on the English Coast -->
<!-- [@larsonneur_1982]. From the western end up to Guernsey and the Hurd -->
<!-- Deep, stratification occurs in summer, which is broken down as water -->
<!-- progresses towards the east, resulting no vertical temperature gradient -->
<!-- to be present in the eastern EC [@holme_1966].  -->
Seafloor temperatures vary less in the western EC (range: 9°C to 14°C) than in
the eastern EC (8°C and 16°C). Species living on the
seafloor include Crustacea like the edible crab (*Cancer pagurus*), the
common spider crab (*Maja squinado*), the European lobster (*Homarus
gammarus*) and *Upogebia spp.* [@holme_1966; @vaz_2007].

## The Permanent Belgian Receiver Network

The acoustic receivers of the Permanent Belgian Receiver Network (PBARN)
were used in this study. The PBARN is part of the European Tracking
Network (ETN), which was established in 2017 as a pan-european aquatic
telemetry network. As of 2019, the PBARN consisted of
160 permanently installed and monitored acoustic receivers within the
BPNS, the Scheldt Estuary, the Dijle, Rupel, Albert Canal and the Meuse
River [@reubens_2018]. @fig-mapWSdetail displays an overview of the acoustic receivers in the estuary of the Western Scheldt. A detection probability of \>50 % was estimated for a radius of 500-700 m around the receiver [@goossens_2022], and \>70
% for 200 m radius [@reubens_2018].

<!-- The  data  originated  from   6  2     self  -  contained,  single  channe  l  (69  kHz),  submersible     Vemco     acoustic   receivers  . These receivers were attached to buoys and/or   bottom moorings     and were removed either   manually, either with an acoustic release system.   23     acoustic receivers were   deployed     in the BPNS at   spread out position  s and 39 were set up in the Scheldt Estuary in three receiver   array  s.

<!-- ### Data Management -->

<!-- <!-- *change title* --> 

<!-- The database of the European Tracking Network (https://lifewatch.be/etn) -->
<!-- stores the acoustic detections, and metadata connected to the animal -->
<!-- individuals and the tags used. <!-- make etn link into citation The -->
<!-- data storage log files and the outputs of the geolocation models were -->
<!-- accessed and management via the Marine Data Archive (MDA, *ref*). -->

<!-- - *Question: TABLE with lat lon & names of receiver stations?* noooo right? -->

## Ethics statement

The care and use of the animals complied with the Belgian Animal Welfare
Act, guidelines and policies as approved by the *Ethische Commissie
Dierproeven* (project reference EC2017-080). All animal treatments were
undertaken in 2018 and 2019, and all tagging procedures were carried out
by competent and trained personal license holders.

## Data Analysis and visualisation

All data analyses were carried out using R [@R_2022], primarily using
the packages `dplyr` [@dplyr] and `lubridate` [@lubridate].
<!-- All maps were created using the *'leaflet'*-package.  -->
Geospatial data, where not otherwise indicated, was queried from
the marineregions database [@claus_2014] in the case of (marine) boundaries [with the
`mregions2`-package, @mregions2], and EMODnet Human Activities [@solaun_2021] data [with
the `EMODnetWFS`-package, @EMODnetWFS]. All plots were generated using the
`ggplot2`-package [@ggplot2]. Packages used for specific data analyses are
indicated in the respective section.
<!-- To Do: name all required packages for an analysis -->

### Acoustic Detections

Detections were accessed from the ETN database (*https://www.lifewatch.be/etn/*). Tags with only a single
detection were omitted from all further analyses. Acoustic detections were visualised on an individual and acoustic receiver station level.

<!-- ***I'm not sure yet which calculations I will include yet. Maybe something concerned with monthly summary statistics. But maybe this also is too much and I should just put the vertical space use analysis and leave out the rest. With the rest I mean things I show here: (https://lottepohl.github.io/thesis_docs/20230227_acoustic_data_month_sex/)*** -->

<!-- ***see @sec-questionacousticanalyses for my question about what -->
<!-- analyses/calculations would make sense to include.*** Summary statistics -->
<!-- describing seasonal shark presence around the receivers in the Western -->
<!-- Scheldt were calculated: The number of detections and individuals -->
<!-- detected at each receiver, per month (*rephrase*). -->

<!-- **write: depth use ** -->

<!-- *To compare shark presence around the receivers in the Western Scheldt between seasons, an ANOVA was executed. (**TO DO**)*. -->

<!-- #### Vertical space use analysis -->

<!-- To assess the vertical space use of sharks detected in the WS1 and WS2 -->
<!-- array, the depths transmitted with the detections were compared to the -->
<!-- bathymetry composition around each receiver. The acoustic detections -->
<!-- from 2019 and in the WS1 and WS2 area were used. A bathymetry dataset -->
<!-- from the Flemish government (publication date: November 18, 2019, *ref*) -->
<!-- was used. The dataset has a 1m x 1m resolution and contains the mean -->
<!-- depth per grid cell. The seafloor depth within a radius of 200 m around -->
<!-- each receiver was extracted using the *'sf'*-package in R. The 200 m -->
<!-- refer to the probability of >70% of an acoustic detection [@reubens_2019]. The following was done both for the bathymetry subsets -->
<!-- and the acoustic detections for each receiver station in the WS1 array: -->
<!-- Firstly, the maximum and minimum depth (of seafloor depth and acoustic -->
<!-- detections) around each receiver were extracted, and the percentage of -->
<!-- grid cells/detections that contained a depth value within a 10 m depth -->
<!-- bin (spanning from 0 m to -50 m) was computed. -->

<!-- make reference to dataset: https://madame.vlaanderen.be/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/718dc576-7ddc-43b5-b71e-3bd3617e1bd3 -->

### Data Storage Tags {#sec-mm_dsts}

Depth and temperature logs from the recovered tags were accessed via the
Marine Data Archive (MDA) **create DOI**. <!-- TODO: link URL --> The temperature log
was not included in any analysis. The first week of depth values was
excluded from all analyses to remove potential bias resulting from the
tagging procedure [as suggested by @flavio_2021]. The date of death, used to
calculate the time at liberty for the recovered tags, was visually extracted from plots of the
raw depth series, and marks the date after which only a tidal signal
remains in the depthlog [characterised by cyclically rising and
falling depths within a rough 2 m depth range, @kvale_2006]. 

The analyses described in the following were only performed for tags that logged for $\geq$ 365 days. 
Those will be referred to as *long term DST* in the following, tags logging for less than a year will be
referred to as *short term DST*.
<!-- maybe rephrase: "excluded from all analyses" --> Summary statistics
,i.e., median (since depth did not follow a normal distribution), maximum and 
minimum depth were calculated per date, day and night.
<!-- For all of these calculated summary statistics, the daily change was computed (i.e. * variable~change~ = variable~t~ - variable~t-1~).  -->
For the day/night summaries, sunrise and sunset times were extracted
using the `getSunlightTimes()`-function from the `suncalc`-package [@suncalc].
The illuminated fraction of the moon was extracted using the
`moonAngle()`-function from the `oce` package [@oce]. 

<!-- On the daily summaries, a rolling mean with a window size of 3 days was applied to smooth the data. -->
A Savitzky-Golay smoothing filter [@press_1990,
filter order *p = 1*, filter length *n = 5*] was applied on all summaries using the
`sgolayfilt()`-function from the `signal`-package [@signal]. This particular
filter smoothes the data but retains spikes in the data better than
other smoothing filters like butterworth or averaging filters [like
rolling mean, @schafer_2011].
<!-- Prior to spectral analyses, the data was centred and normalised, -->
<!-- resulting in a mean of 0 and a sd of 1.  -->
<!-- still do!!!! --> 
The autocorrelation was calculated using the `stats::acf()`-function.
Autocorrelation refers to the serial correlation of a data series with
itself [@bartlett_1946], resulting in an autocorrelation coefficient
between -1 and 1 (-1 referring to perfect anti-correlation and 1
referring to perfect correlation, 0 referring to no correlation at all)
over the lag, which refers to the overlap between the data series with
itself.

<!-- check: sollte ich das noch machen?? -->

<!-- The animal's vertical speed (in *m/min*) was calculated following @griffiths_2020, dividing the depth difference between two consecutive measurements by the time interval (in min). -->

A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was performed on all DST logs, using the
`base::fft()`-function. This method decomposes a signal in the time
domain (which is a combination of multiple sine waves with different
frequencies) into its components in the frequency domain. Dominant
frequencies (or rather periods, which is the inverse of the frequency)
give insights about the scale of periodicity of a signal [in the present
case the signal is the depth-timeseries of the sharks, @cochran_1967].

<!-- Then, the daily -->
<!-- summary statistics were subset with the dates that each individual most -->
<!-- likely was in its winter habitat, i.e. during winter and in deeper -->
<!-- waters compared to summer. For the female individual (tag 308), the -->
<!-- depth data was subset between December 12, 2018 and March 11, 2019, and -->
<!-- for the male individual, the depth data was subset between December 09, -->
<!-- 2018 and April 30, 2019. Firstly, the median depth was compared between -->
<!-- day and night, using a one-sided Wilcoxon Test. Then, simple linear -->
<!-- regression was employed to investigate the relationship between the -->
<!-- median depth and the moon phase (represented by the illuminated fraction -->
<!-- of the moon). Two kinds of regression models were done. The first model -->
<!-- takes as input the median depth per date (thus, not considering day and -->
<!-- night). The second model takes as input the median depth per date and -->
<!-- day/night, and tests for an interaction effect of the illuminated -->
<!-- fraction of the moon and whether or not it is day or night. -->

<!-- #### Migration Period Analysis {#sec-mm_migration} -->

<!-- The following steps were only performed on the tags that logged for -->
<!-- \>365 days. -->
<!-- longterm DST logs, that is, tag 1293308 and 1293321. -->

<!-- include function settings for CWT: dt = 1, factor_smallest_scale = 2) -->

Next, Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) was performed on the daily summary
statistics of the longterm DST depthlogs, using the `wt()`-function from the
`biwavelet`-package [@biwavelet]. In contrast to FFT, this method gives insights
into the occurrence of certain frequencies within the time domain. Thus,
not only information about the dominant frequencies is gathered, but
also the time that those frequencies appear. In order to
resolve the components of the frequency domain within the time domain,
however, the resolution of both is minimised.
<!-- (following Heisenberg's uncertainty principle).  -->
To obtain robust and valid results despite the
resolution loss, frequencies were compared against white noise using a
$\chi^2$ test [@grinsted_2004]. 
CWT was performed on both the raw depthlog and the median depth per date, resulting in an hourly and a daily resolution of periodicities. For the wavelet scalograms of the raw depthlog the maximum power per day was included in the scalogram.
<!-- For the present study, a basic version of BCPA was applied to a vertical movement dataset from a demersal shark: Change Point Detection (CPD).  -->

<!-- Finally, daily summary statistics were used to detect abrupt changes in -->
<!-- the depth time series, indicating the start of a migration phase. -->
<!-- Following @aminikhanghahi_2017, *Relative unconstrained Least-Squares -->
<!-- Importance Fitting* [RuLSIF, @liu_2013] is a robust method which is -->
<!-- adequate to use with non-stationary (i.e., statistical properties such -->
<!-- as the mean, or autocorrelation are non-constant over time) time series -->
<!-- data like the dataset at hand. RuLSIF is a density-ratio estimation -->
<!-- method and, in brief, approximates the dissimilarity of two subsequent -->
<!-- time intervals $\chi$ and $\chi'$, using an $\alpha$*-relative Pearson -->
<!-- Divergence* (rPE), with $0 < \alpha < 1$. By making the dissimilarity -->
<!-- measure relative, the risk of infinite density ratios is circumvented -->
<!-- [@liu_2013]. -->

<!-- RuLSIF was employed with the *'ts_detect()'*-function from the -->
<!-- *'rulsif.ts'*-package [@brubaker_2021]. The algorithm can take an -->
<!-- n-dimensional time series as input, as such allowing for more than one -->
<!-- calculated summary statistic to be used as input. In this case, the -->
<!-- Savitzky-Golay-filtered (see @sec-mm_dsts) daily median depth, maximum -->
<!-- and minimum were chosen. These three parameters describe the daily depth -->
<!-- use in a basic but overseeable way, making the interpretation of results -->
<!-- easier. -->

<!-- Hyperparameters are non-learned settings of a machine learning algorithm -->
<!-- that control the learning behaviour during the algorithm's training -->
<!-- [@yang_2020]. Several hyperparameters needed to be chosen: the relative -->
<!-- parameter $\alpha$, the window size *w*, the number of samples before -->
<!-- and after a data point to compare between (*step*), and the threshold of -->
<!-- the relative PE score above which a time point is classified as a change -->
<!-- point (*thresh*). Hyperparameters were either chosen based on already -->
<!-- established settings (here, $\alpha$ was kept at the function's default -->
<!-- of 0.05) of the RuLSIF algorithm, based on ecological properties of the -->
<!-- dataset (*w* = 7, because roughly one week long migrations were -->
<!-- expected), or logical reasoning (*thresh = 0.95*, higher than the -->
<!-- default 0.9, thus requiring the divergence measure (the rPE score) to be -->
<!-- relatively high for a point to be classified as a change point). As -->
<!-- default in `ts_detect()`, *step* is set to 10% of the amount of time -->
<!-- points in the dataset used, but it is advised to decrease the step if -->
<!-- computational resources allow for it [since smaller steps increase -->
<!-- computation time, @brubaker_2021]. In the present study, RuLSIF was -->
<!-- performed for different values of *step*: 2.5%, 5% and 10% of the input -->
<!-- dataset length. For example, the DST 321 logged for 471 days, and a -->
<!-- *step* of 5% of the input dataset length would amount to a *step* of 24 -->
<!-- (days, rounded to the nearest integer). To group detected change points -->
<!-- into change periods, change points that were less than 7 days apart from -->
<!-- each other were classified as the same change period. -->

<!-- Thirdly, the daily summary statistics and the results from the wavelet analysis (i.e., significantly present periods per day), were used as input for k-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. Unsupervised (as opposed to supervised) learning was utilised in this case because it does not require a training dataset with known right answers (which in this case would be the days that the sharks are migrating). -->

<!-- The algorithm was run n = 100 (**DO!**) times each for a number of clusters from 1 to 8. The optimal number of clusters was identified using the *elbow*-method (**reference**). -->

<!-- Next, FFT was performed on each cluster separately, after the predominant cluster per week was assigned to all data points within that week. The last step was done to smooth the clustering result and reclassify potential outliers. -->

<!-- In addition, CWT was performed on the hourly summary statistics for each cluster. -->

# Results {#sec-results}

## Tagged animals

Tagging of 30 *M. asterias* individuals occurred in July and August, 2018
(`r tagging_info$date2[1]`, n = `r tagging_info$n[1]`,
`r tagging_info$date2[2]` and 03, n = `r tagging_info$n[2]` and n =
`r tagging_info$n[3]`) and in July, 2019 (`r tagging_info$date2[4]` and
12, n = `r tagging_info$n[4]` for both dates). Details on the tagged
individuals are listed in @tbl-animalinfo. Of the
`r tagged_animal_info %>% dplyr::filter(sex == "m") %>% nrow()` males
that were tagged, `r tagged_animal_info %>% dplyr::filter(sex == "m", n_detect > 1) %>% nrow()` were detected more than once. 3 of the detected males were detected in the year
following their tagging. Of the
`r tagged_animal_info %>% dplyr::filter(sex == "f") %>% nrow()` tagged
females,
`r tagged_animal_info %>% dplyr::filter(sex == "f", n_detect > 1) %>% nrow()`

## Acoustic detections

Two tags only had a single detection (serial number
`r tag_serial_number_omit[1,] %>% dplyr::pull()` and
`r tag_serial_number_omit[2,] %>% dplyr::pull()`) and were thus omitted
from all further analyses. The acoustic detections of the remaining tags
over time are shown in @fig-abacus.
Within the study period from July, 2018 to August, 2020, there are no
acoustic detections between November and April in either year.
`r round((detections_tempdepth_daynight %>% dplyr::filter(area == "WS1") %>% nrow() / detections_tempdepth_daynight %>% nrow()) * 100, digits = 2)`% of detections are in the WS1 area, and of those,
`r round((detections_tempdepth_daynight %>% dplyr::filter(station_name == "ws-OG10") %>% nrow()) / (detections_tempdepth_daynight %>% dplyr::filter(area == "WS1") %>% nrow()) * 100, digits = 2)`% are at station OG10 (see @fig-mapdetail). Of the
`r tagged_animal_info %>% dplyr::filter(sex == "m", n_detect > 1) %>% nrow()`
detected males, 3 were detected inside the BPNS and one in the WS1
array.
Across all years, most detections (n = 2484) were in the month of May,
while most individuals (n = 10) were detected in August.
`r sharks_returned` out of `r sharks_detected` (`r round((sharks_returned / sharks_detected) * 100)` %) individuals were acoustically detected in the year following their release.

The acoustic detections at each receiver station of female *M. asterias* within the Westerschelde are shown in @fig-heatmapdetections. The receiver stations are ordered by latitude (from north to south), and by receiver array (station OG10 to W7 are in the WS1 array, and station borssele to 4 are in the WS2 array). The number of acoustic detections has a high dispersion (excluding months without detections, `r detections_sum_station$n_detect %>% mean()` $\pm$ `r detections_sum_station$n_detect %>% sd()`, median = `r detections_sum_station$n_detect %>% median()`). Most detections (n = 2103) were at station OG10 in October, 2019. This is almost twice as much as the second most detections (n = 1097 at the same station in May, 2020). Most individuals (n = 6) were detected at station WN2 in August and September, 2018.

Acoustic detections of female *M. asterias* at receiver station OG10 in 2019 are shown in @fig-heatmapOG10. 
The acoustic detections of an individual at a day (`r round(detections_OG102019$n_detect %>% mean(), digits = 2)` $\pm$ `r round(detections_OG102019$n_detect %>% sd(), digits = 2)`, median = `r detections_OG102019$n_detect %>% median()`) are maximal for tag 299 with n = 232 detections on October 13, 2019.
The number of days that an individual was detected at station OG10 are highly dispersed (`r detections_OG102019_sum$days_detected %>% mean()` $\pm$ `r round(detections_OG102019_sum$days_detected %>% sd(), digits = 2)` days, median = `r detections_OG102019_sum$days_detected %>% median()` days). 
<!-- Tag 308, 299 and 297 show periods  -->
The number of days detected between individuals above the median of `r detections_OG102019_sum$days_detected %>% median()` days is significantly greater than that of individuals at or below the median (one-sided Welch Two Sample t-test, $\alpha$ = 0.95, *p* = `r detections_OG10_ttest$p.value`).

### Raw depth and temperature logs

The depth and temperature logs of tag 308 and 321 (the two long term
DST) are shown in @fig-dst308-1 and @fig-dst321-1, respectively. Exemplary subsets from summer and winter are also shown.
The temperature logs and all raw depth and temperature logs of the short term DST are included in **Annex A**.

The full depthlog of tag 308 (@fig-dst308-1), comprising 366 days, shows depth between 0 and 20 m between the time of tagging in August, 2018, and the beginning of October. Then the depth gets deeper over a period of about two weeks, and between mid-November and mid-December the sensor recorded depths between 50 and 75 m. From December, 2018 until March, 2019, the depth ranges between 75 m and close to the water surface. From mid-March on, the depth remains shallower than 60 m. From May to June, 2019, depth is relatively constant around 17 m, from mid-June to mid-July it is relatively constant around 10 m and until the sensor stops recording the depth goes back to just under 20 m.
@fig-dst308-2 shows an exemplary subset of the depthlog of tag 308 in September, 2018. Roughly, the depth alternates between 12  - 14 and 16 - 20 m in a sinusoidal pattern with a wavelength of about 12 hours.
The subset in @fig-dst308-3 shows a period of a month between Febuary and March, 2019. Here, periods of smaller depth ranges from 40 to 60 m (between Febuary 11 and 18 and between Febuary 25 and March 3) can be observed with periods of larger depth ranges from 5 to 75 m (between Febuary 18 and 24) in between, can be observed.


The full depthlog of tag 321 (@fig-dst321-1) is 485 days long and shows depth ranges between 0 and 30 m from tagging until the end of October, 2018. Then, depth gets deeper over a period of roughly 10 days, stays at 35 to 50 m until December, 2018 and then ranges from 5 m to 50 m until March, 2019. Until May, 2019 depth ranges between 10 and 35 m, then the sensor recorded depth values of 60 m on May 03, 2019. After that, depth gets shallower with ranges from 0 to mostly 20 m until mid-September. Until the end of the depthlog November 15, 2019, depth gets deeper to around 35 m and then to around 40 m.
The exemplary depthlog of September, 2018 in @fig-dst321-2 shows a depth range between 10 and 15 m during daytime (a sinusoidal pattern similar to the one in @fig-dst308-2), and during night minimum depths of around 2 m during night time.
The subset from February to March, 2019 (@fig-dst321-3) shows depth ranges from 5 to 55m with no observable pattern of larger or smaller depth ranges on a weekly scale.

<!-- The raw depth and temperature logs of the short term DST are depicted in @sec-annexdst_raw. -->

<!-- Tag 295 (@fig-dst-1) shows regular up- and downward movements with minimum depths per day of around 2 m and maximum daily depths between 18 and 35 m. After August 20, 2018, only a tidal signal and no up and down movements were recorded.

@fig-dstsum308-1 displays a daily maximum of about 20 m until end September
and then, until the start of October the daily median depth gets deeper, reaching 75 m. Until the beginning of December the shark uses waters with minimum daily
depths not shallower than 50 m. After that until mid March the daily
maximum depth is between 40 and 68 m and the daily minimum depth is
between 5 and 50 m. After March 19, 2019, the daily median depth is
always shallower than 60 m. Between March until the end of the time
series, some plateaus in median depth occur: Around 35 m median depth
from end March to end April, around 17 m depth from mid May to the start
of June and from end July onward, and around 8 m depth between June 11
and July 13, 2019.

The minimum depth during the night is significantly shallower than during the day (one-sided Welch Two Sample t-test, $\alpha$ = 0.95, *p* =
`r daynight_depth_308_ttest$p.value`). From December, 2018 to May, 2019, the minimum and median depth per day [@fig-dstsum308-2] show peaks following a rough biweekly pattern, getting the shallowest when the illuminated moon fraction is maximal and minimal. During the night [@fig-dstsum321-3], a rather monthly pattern can be observed for that time period. Here, the median and minimum depth are shallowest when the illuminated fraction of the moon is maximal.

The male shark (tag 321, @fig-dstsum321-1) uses waters shallower than 20 m between August and October, 2018. From October 21 until November 03, 2018, the daily median depth gets consistently deeper, reaching depths of around 45 m throughout November, 2018. Between December 09, 2019 and January 21, 2019, the daily median depth ranges from 22 to 33 m and the maximum and minimum depth between 53 and 16 m, respectively. After dropping to 39 m on January 28, 2019, the daily median depth gets shallower until April 30, reaching depths of 22 m. Then, the daily median depth increases substantially between April 27 and May 05, ranging between 22 m and 6 m until October 05. From October 08 to 19, 2019, the daily median depth changes from 17 to 45 m. Until the log stops on November 16, the daily median depth ranges between 45 and 32 m.

The minimum depth during the night is significantly shallower than during the day (one-sided Welch Two Sample t-test, $\alpha$ = 0.95, *p* =
`r daynight_depth_321_ttest$p.value`). The median depth per day [@fig-dstsum321-2] shows slight peaks in a biweekly pattern between January and July, 2019. The peaks of the median depth at night [@fig-dstsum321-3] show no visually noticeable pattern.

There are no acoustic detections at all between November and April in all years with acoustic detections (2018-2020, @fig-abacus). This suggests a seasonal presence of *M. asterias* in the Western Scheldt between April and November. The months of May and October had the most acoustic detections while most individuals were detected in August. Therefore, it is difficult at this point to narrow down the time window of April until November to especially relevant periods for the species in the area and it is recommended to study the seasonal presence of *M. asterias* in the Western Scheldt with greater detail in the future.
According to the acoustic detections, a hotspot of seasonal presence of mature *M. asterias* females is around the receiver OG10 (`r round((detections_tempdepth_daynight %>% dplyr::filter(station_name == "ws-OG10") %>% nrow()) / (detections_tempdepth_daynight %>% nrow()) * 100, digits = 2)`
% of detections, and 10 out of 14 detected females, see @fig-heatmapOG10). According to fishermen, the area offshore from Zoetelande (north of Dishoek) is a *M. asterias* fishing hotspot, so the coastal waters between Diskoek and Zoetelande are suggested to be important for the species. Whether or not the potential aggregations of mature females is related to parturition should be subject of further studies. There are several indications, however,
that point towards the Westerschelde and/or its surrounding waters to be
a pupping area for *M. asterias*. The Eastern Scheldt is a confirmed
pupping ground [@breve_2016], and during the tagging for this study in
August, 2018, two neonates [around 30 cm TL, @farrell_2010] were caught[^3].

[^3]: Verhelst, Pieterjan (*personal communication*), April 25, 2023.

Another important fact to consider is the biannual reproductive cycle of *M. asterias* and whether that implies differing seasonal habitat use between years of pregnancy and years without a pregnancy. 
Females were either detected at a lot of days (20 - 40) or few (5 - 10) days during summer 2019 (see @fig-heatmapOG10). This could indicate different behaviourial states between the females with many and few acoustically detected days, further supported by the wide dispersion in Residency Indices which are shown in the figure.

The high dispersion of days of acoustic detections of female sharks at station OG10 in 2019 show 
In the future, it could be helpful to assess if adult females are pregnant at the time of release, through ultrasonography or the use of sex steroid hormones, both of which have already been employed to determine pregnancy in sharks [@awruch_2014; @smukall_2019; @anderson_2018; @fujinami_2020; @fujinami_2021]. This would allow for further clarification if the Western Scheldt is used as a pupping ground, and if it might be a relevant area for non-pregnant females, too.
An area with little presence of the tagged *M. asterias* individuals is the Western Scheldt upstream past Flushing. Shallow and sheltered coastal habitats are thought to be suitable pupping grounds for sharks in general [@speed_2010] and for *M. asterias* in particular [@ellis_2004; @ellis_2005]. The low number of acoustically detected sharks (38 detections in the WS2 array throughout the whole study period from 2018 to 2020) indicates that the waters past Flushing are not as frequently used as the waters around Dishoek. 
The Scheldt Estuary is influenced by two water bodies from the North Sea, the Channel water and the Continental coastal water [@wolff_1973, see @sec-mmscheldtBPNS]. The boundary between those bodies is approximately 30 km offshore from the Estuary, and in the Continental coastal waters nutrients are abundant (unlike in the Channel water). This, together with monthly water temperatures above 15 °C between June and September make the (Western) Scheldt Estuary a potentially suitable pupping habitat. The fact that few sharks were detected upstream past Flushing could be due to low salinities, or to anthropogenic influences like dredging. This, however, should be further investigated in follow-up studies.
*M. asterias* might leave the area of the Western Scheldt during winter because of decreasing water temperature [@breve_2016], a main predictor of elasmobranch occurrence [@martin_2010]. The warmer waters in the Channel area might be favourable especially for gestating females since higher water temperatures increase metabolic rate and thereby improve embryo development [@hurst_1999].

<!--which was also. Substantially decreased presence of *M. asterias* in the Dutch delta was linked to water temperature < 13 °C [@breve_2016]. Since water temperatures are a main predictor of elasmobranch occurrence [@martin_2010].  It was therefore unexpected to have only 38 acoustic detections in the WS2 array which can be considered more sheltered than the WS1 array, and no detection in the WS3 array. This, together with the high numbers of detections in the WS1 array indicates that the waters around the WS1 array are more utilized and thus more relevant for the species as compared to the Western Scheldt estuary upstream past Flushing. Possible reasons for the low presence of *M. asterias* can be salinity (the salinity tolerance of the species), limited availability of prey, or water quality.  -->

<!-- Season of peak presence of adult females: April – September -->
<!-- Area around dishoek and zoetelande = hotspot, estuary upstream past Flushing: not so important -->
<!-- Only some tagged females are very present in the area, indicating that there could be differences in habitat use between pregnant and non-pregnant females. -->
<!-- Whether that implies that non-pregnant females use other parts of the estuary (e.g. receiver WN2 that also saw many detections in 2018) or that they use completely different areas cannot be said at this moment -->
<!-- No direct evidence of pupping, (more investigation needed), but presence of females in summer (somewhat sheltered area, warm temperatures, i.e. good conditions for pupping) suggest it -->
<!-- The absence of M. asterias in the Western Scheldt in winter might be related to temperature, since  -->
<!-- Waters in the Western Scheldt drop to ~5 degrees in winter -->
<!-- temperature often controls seasonal species occurrence -->
<!-- waters in e.g. the English channel are warmer in winter, so especially for gestating females it might be faviourable to move into warmer waters in winter to have good conditions for developing pups --> 

## Data Storage Tags

### Seasonal and sex-specific vertical movement patterns {#sec-disc-dst-movementpatterns}

<!-- From Figure 7 (daily depth summary) -->
<!-- Briefly state that due to the demersal lifestyle of the species, shallower depths means a shorewards, horizontal movement of the individual and no vertical movement into the water column -->
<!-- Generally: 12h periodicity refers to resting on the seafloor (pure tidal signal), 24h periods refer to diel vertical migration potentially related to feeding -->

Overall, cyclidity can be observed for both the female and the male shark logging data for more than a year.  The autocorrelograms (@fig-acf) show similar seasonal patterns with an autocorrelation of zero at lags of 81 and 264 days for the female, and 75 and 256 days for the male. The lags correspond to roughly 3 and 9 months, suggesting a change of vertical movement behavior at these time scales. Global minima lie at lags of 170 and 138 days for female and male, respectively. These lags roughly correspond to 5 months and indicate that vertical behaviour is anti-correlated within this time scale, further underlining the observation of higher vertical activity and the use of deeper waters during winter and a contrary behaviour with low vertical activity use of shallow waters during summer. Local autocorrelation maxima lie at 300 and 345 days for female and male, respectively. This corresponds to 10-12 months and points towards a yearly cyclicity for both the male and the female shark.
In general, owing to the demersal lifestyle of *M. asterias*, shallower depths in the depthlog indicate a shoreward movement along the seafloor, as opposed to a vertical movement into the water column. If, for example, the depthlog shows shallower depths during the night (as can be seen in  @fig-dst321-2) this suggests a movement into shallower, coastal waters to feed.

#### Summer

From both recovered DSTs that logged data for over a year, the daily vertical range and median depth are shallower in summer (June – September, around 17 m median depth for the female and around 10 m median depth for the male, both with ranges between 0 and 20 m) than in winter (December – March). 
<!-- This implies that the sharks move into shallow waters at least for a short time per day (the female shark’s daily minimum depth averages 3.7 m between its release on August 2, 2018 and September 25, 2018). -->
The wavelet scalograms of the raw depthlogs (@fig-waveletresults308-1 and @fig-waveletresults321-1) show a difference in periodicity on the hourly scale between males and females. Both in the summer of 2018 and 2019, the female shows mainly a periodicity of 12 h (indicated by band of high power in red colour), which is a pure tidal signal (since from one high tide to the next one it takes approximately 12 h, the same holds true for low tide).  In 2018, there are some periodicities of 24 h (represented by yellow colours) as opposed to 2019, where the power of the 24 h period is below zero. This could be an indicator of the biannual reproductive cycle [with females feeding when they are not pregnant, and they stop feeding during the migration to parturition grounds and parturition itself, @michael_2006, p. 23] but this requires further investigation in the future. The 12 h periodicity, however, is the most prevalent one in both summer for the female and thus implies that the female itself expresses no to little vertical activity and is only resting on the seafloor (observable in the exemplary subset of the raw depthlog in @fig-dst308-2).
The male, on the other hand, shows a periodicity of 24 h. This can be seen as a high-power band in red colours at the 24 h period in the wavelet scalogram on the hourly scale (@fig-waveletresults321-1) and in @fig-dst321-2.
This suggests vertical migration, which has been observed in several shark species, for example the spiny dogfish *Squalus acanthias* [@carlson_2014]. Diel vertical migration is believed to be related to foraging and feeding, following the nightly vertical migration of zooplankton to feed [@griffiths_2020].

#### Migration into winter habitat {#sec-disc-wintermig}

From September 25 on for the female and October 21 for the male, the daily median depth gets progressively deeper over a period of around 15 to 20 days, which potentially is the migration period of these individuals.
Interestingly, both individuals go to the maximum depth logged by the tag within the logging period directly the potential migration into the winter habitat. During this time, the female shark goes to depths below the tag’s measuring limit of 68 m, as indicated by a straight line in the raw depthlog (see @fig-dst308-1). This provides further evidence of the species utilizing deeper waters than previously thought, as argued by @griffiths_2020 that found a maximum recorded depth of 118 m in a female shark in December [@griffiths_2020, S4].
The male shark goes to depths between 40 and 45 m, both in 2018 and 2019. Since this tag logged for 485 days, the migration into the winter habitat was recorded for two years. The start date of the potential winter migration in 2019 differs to the one in 2018 by 10 days. The autocorrelation of the depthlog of tag 321 has a local maximum of 345 days [see @fig-acf-2] which further reflects the almost perfect yearly cyclicity of tag 321.
Both individuals stay at their respective maximum depths for approximately one month (the female between the end of October until the end of November, 2018 and the male between the start of November until the start of December, 2018). This behaviour could be related to resting after the migration or escaping potential predators. The behaviour after the completion of the migration was not further assessed at this point and could be subject of future studies. 
<!-- Furthermore, the male shark (tag 321) logged longer than the female, and there the hourly wavelet scalogram shows high prevalence of periods from 4 h to 64 h in the first week of October 2019. A stark depth increase can also be seen in the daily median depth [@fig-dstsum-2], indicating the individual’s migration to its winter habitat.  -->

#### Winter

During the winter months between December and March, both individuals show roughly biweekly periodicities (see @fig-waveletresults308-2 and @fig-waveletresults321-2). This vertical movement behaviour could be linked to moon phases.
The female shark shows a rather biweekly vertical movement pattern during night and and a monthly pattern for depth use during the day (@fig-dstsum308-2 and @fig-dstsum308-3), In the raw depthlog, periods of resting and subsequent periods of high vertical activity are visually discernable, see @@fig-dst308-3. Both of these periodicities can be seen in the wavelet scalogram at daily scale [@fig-waveletresults308-2]
During the night, this individual goes to depth shallower than 10 m between December, 2018 and May, 2019. The peaks in minimum depth align well with a full moon, potentially reflecting visual predation behaviour coupled with diel vertical migration, i.e., the shark moves to shallower depths during full moon (when the moonlight is most intense), feeding on crustaceans that follow the nocturnal zooplankton migration. Visual foraging and preying of *M. asterias* was already assumed by @griffiths_2020. During the day, median and minimum depth are deepest at full moon and new moon. These moon phases generally result in the most intense tidal currents throughout a moon cycle [@arnold_1994]. The exact strength of tidal currents, however, depends on the bathymetry of the area, and since the location of the shark is not exactly known, interpretations regarding tidal currents should be taken cautiously. Since the female, however, is thought to have migrated into the English Channel [an area with exceptionally high tidal currents, @salomon_1993], it is a plausible explanation that this individual was resting on the seafloor during periods of intense tidal currents (as can be seen in @fig-dst308-3), and moving to shallower waters to visually feed at full moon.

For the male shark, the biweekly periodicity is less present, in general, and no apparent periodicity can be visually detected during the night (@fig-dstsum321-2 and @fig-dstsum321-3). This could be an indication of a different feeding behaviour of the male, involving less visual predation. The hourly wavelet scalogram (@fig-waveletresults321-1) shows the presence of 24 h periodicities in January and February, 2019, but the daily wavelet scalogram (@fig-waveletresults321-2) does not contain significantly present monthly periodicities. This suggests that the male shark relies less on the moonlight to predate than the female shark. The significant presence of 14 day periods between December, 2018 and May, 2019, however, could potentially relate to tidal currents. This is less visually observable from the median and minimum depth during the day (@fig-dstsum321-2). 
The male shark is thought to move northwards from the Scheldt Estuary during its winter migration where tidal currents are generally less intense than in the English Channel (**ref**). This could be a potential explanation for the weaker biweekly periodicity in the male shark's median and minimum depth. The male does not show clearly detectable periods with pure resting behaviour during winter (as shown in @fig-dst321-3). Whether this difference in vertical behaviour patterns is sex-specific and related to a potential gestation of the female shark, or to different feeding modes, could be a point of further investigation in the future.

In general, the effect of the moon illumination and tidal currents would be interesting to study further since this can give relevant insights about (potentially sex-specific) winter behaviour of *M. asterias*, for example through comparing wavelet scalograms from median depth during the day and during the night.


<!-- , which was further assessed in @sec-results-moonphases and is discussed in the following.  -->

<!-- **Influence of moon phases on vertical activity of *M. asterias* ** -->

<!--  -	Simple linear regression shows that minimum depth is correlated with the fraction illuminated by the moon. That could mean the the shark goes to shallower depths during full moon to visually prey there, as suggested by Griffiths et al., 2020. The residuals seem to follow a normal distribution (as can be seen in the qq-plot and the density plot), but the R^2 is very low. An effect that potentially is related to the depth use of M. asterias, especially in the English Channel region is the intensity of tidal currents. While this variable is difficult to test for, since the exact location of the individual is not known, it is hypothesized that tidal currents also have an influence on the vertical behaviour, in addition to the light provided by the moon. This could already be shown in visually hunting sharks like the great white shark Carcharodon carcharias (?) (ref) -->
<!-- - 	Final interpretation: the depth use of the shark is correlated with the moon phase (which is illustrated in the plots as the fraction of the moon illuminated).  -->
<!-- - 	Since both the depth per day and the depth per night are correlated with the fraction of the moon illuminated, it is inferred that the preying behaviour is not influenced by the intensity of moonlight, i.e. a sole influence of moonlight intensity on preying and foraging behaviour (that is thought to be swimming to shallower depths) -->
<!-- - 	Instead, it is hypothesized that vertical activity, especially by the female in winter, might be related to the intensity of tidal currents. This relationship is more complex to address and therefore beyond the scope of this work, since tidal currents differ strongly with location.  -->


#### Migration into summer habitat {#sec-disc-summermig}

In spring, roughly between April and May, the daily median depth gets shallower in a stepwise manner for both individuals which potentially reflects the migration into the summer habitat. The female (tag 308) was detected in the receiver areas of the BPNS and WS1 in the year following its release, proving the individual’s return, and providing further evidence of philopatric behaviour for the species, as suggested by @breve_2016 and first directly reported by @griffiths_2020.
The start and duration of the summer migration cannot be identified as clearly from the daily median depth as the winter migration since the depth does not decrease drastically over a period of few weeks. From the wavelet scalograms of the raw depthlog (@fig-waveletresults308-1 and @fig-waveletresults321-1) the time of potential migration into the summer habitat shows a band of high power throughout periods from 4 to 64 hours (i.e., high prevalence of these periods), albeit this is does not significantly differ from white noise (and is thus slightly transparent). Since the winter period also involves vertical activity, there is no clearly visible change in periodicity patterns between winter months up until March and the months of April and May, during which the daily median depth decreases stepwise for the female shark.
During April 2019, the male shark does not show any prevailing periodicity patterns in the wavelet scalogram at hourly scale [@fig-waveletresults321-1]. The month of May 2019, however, shows prevalent periodicities between 12 and 64 h, potentially indicating migration behaviour. There is decreased vertical activity compared to the winter months from mid-May onwards for the female and from June on for the male, indicating that the individuals might have arrived at their summer habitat by then.
At this point, knowledge about the exact spectral signature of *M. asterias* migration behaviour is lacking and it is suggested to be further studied. Moreover, a more detailed investigation of the difference in vertical movement between the migration into the winter and the summer habitat could be an interesting focus for future investigations. 

<!-- •	Vertical range and median depth in summer much shallower than in winter -->
<!-- •	Depth increases fast (over 7-10 days) between summer and winter  potential migration to winter habitat -->
<!-- •	In spring, roughly between April and may, the depth gradually decreases  potential migration to summer habitat -->
<!-- •	In winter, the female displays shallower daily depths in a roughly biweekly pattern. The same is visible for the male, but less clearly -->
<!-- From Figure 8 and 9 (periodograms of depthlog subsets) -->
<!-- •	Migrations to winter and summer show different characteristics and thus suggest different behavioural patterns and routes -->
<!-- o	The female seems to feed during the winter migration but not during the summer migration (sign of pregnancy?) -->

## Gained ecological knowledge on *M. asterias* in the context of *M. asterias* and related species

*Mustelus asterias* is a common species in the North Sea and the English Channel, both of which areas experience high anthropogenic impact (**ref**). Since knowledge about the species and its relatives is still limited, the following section aims to give a brief overview of how the knowledge gathered in this study fits into already existing ecological knowledge about *M. asterias* and related species.

Comparisons about reproductive behaviour must be made cautiously since not all members of the genus *Mustelus* exhibit aplacental viviparity like *M. asterias*. *M. asterias*, for instance, was often mistaken for the common smooth-hound *M. mustelus* before the development of a simple genetic method to distinguish the two species [@farrell_2009], yet this relative is placentally viviparous [@dasilva_2018].  The gummy shark *M. antarcticus* inhabits Australian waters and exhibits matrotrophic aplacental viviparity like *M. asterias*, making it well comparable [@walker_2007]. Moreover the same study uncovered asynchronous breeding cycles (of one and two years) related to different locations for *M. antarcticus*. This behaviour is also known to occur in Squalid sharks [@braccini_2006], but there is no evidence of *M. asterias* exhibiting different breeding cycle lengths. 
The reproductive biology of *M. asterias*, however, involves complex characteristics like embryo asynchronism, for instance. This refers to pups with different developmental stages, potentially resulting from sperm storage and selective fertilization by the females [@farrell_2010a]. While an in-depth stock assessment has already been carried out for *M. antarcticus* by @pribac_2005, this is still lacking for *M. asterias* and should be done [@mccullyphillips_2015]. 

Annual migration behaviour has not been investigated in depth for many *Mustelus* species.  In fact, the gummy shark *M. antarcticus* is reported to be less mobile than other elasmobranchs in the area of Western Australia [according to a three-year acoustic monitoring study involving 100 tagged *M. antarcticus*, @braccini_2017], but still able to cover distances of > 60 km per day, and overall distances of almost 1000 km. The narrownose smooth-hound shark *Mustelus schmitti*, an aplacentally viviparious relative of *M. asterias* that inhabits waters in the south-west Atlantic, is thought to exhibit similar seasonal migration patterns as *M. asterias*. @elisio_2019 argues that although migration patterns of *M. schmitti* are still unknown, large-sized individuals are increasingly abundant in deeper waters during autumn and winter [@cortes_2011], suggesting a seasonal migration to shallower waters.  The same study reported parturition events of *M. schmitti* in coastal waters during spring and summer, following warming temperatures above 16 °C. These findings align well with conclusions from @breve_2016 that reported decreased presence of *M. asterias* in the Dutch Delta for temperatures < 13°C. The water temperature of the two long term DST logs from the present study is slightly above 16°C for the female and 15°C for the male in October 2018, when the two individuals are thought to start migrating into the winter habitat, further supporting the findings of @breve_2016 and @elisio_2019.

<!-- Compare findings of this study to Griffiths 2020, breve 2016 -->

Overall, the results of the present study go in line with already gathered knowledge on *M. asterias*.  The geolocation model results suggest that the male shark spends the winters in waters north of the Scheldt Estuary and the female goes into the English Channel, as assumed by @breve_2020 and @griffiths_2020. Different overwintering spots for the female and the male shark are further supported by the presumable stronger effect of moon phases and tidal currents on the vertical activity of the female *M. asterias*, potentially sheltering from the intense tidal currents in the English Channel. The present study, however, only involved year-long DST logs from two individuals, so any inferences from this data have to be taken cautiously.
The high return rate (`r round((sharks_returned / sharks_detected) * 100)` %) of individuals into the Western Scheldt as shown by the acoustic detections in the acoustic receiver array further underlines philopatric behaviour in regard to the species’ summer habitat, the Southern North Sea [@griffiths_2020].

## The potential of ADST for M. asterias

For the present study, a novel type of electronic combination tag was utilized, the Acoustic Data Storage Tag, combining acoustic detections with data storage logs. For maximum data overlap, the tag should both be acoustically detected and retrieved (to access the depth and temperature logs). This was the case for 3 out of the 30 tags deployed in this study. Tag 319 was detected 7 times, and the individual (f) died 19 days post-release, tag 295 was detected 21 times and the shark (m) died 30 days post-release, and tag 308 was detected 2067 times and this female was acoustically detected last 366 days post-release. Thus, only one tag (tag 308) shows sufficient overlap between acoustic detections and the depth and temperature logs. @fig-adst308 shows that tag 308 was detected at the Birkenfels receiver station (which is in the BPNS) 63 days after the DST depthlog stopped. This suggests the departure of the individual from the BPNS and the Scheldt Estuary and aligns almost perfectly with the depthlog of that time one year before, where the female went to waters deeper than 25 m from October 06, 2018, onwards. While the annual cyclicity for the male could already be shown from its depthlog since it logged well over a year (see @sec-disc-wintermig), the detection of tag 308 at the Birkenfels station points towards an almost perfect annual cyclicity for this individual, too.
Generally, ADST are a well-suited tracking technology for *M. asterias*, owing to their seasonally differing resident and migratory behaviour. It allows for gaining high-resolution presence/absence data within the areas of receiver networks and insights about the vertical movement of an individual independent of the acoustic detections, given that the tag is retrieved. Moreover, the acoustic detections provide punctual ground truth for geolocation modelling. This is especially helpful in highly mixed areas with homogeneous bathymetry like the Scheldt Estuary (such areas generally result in limited reliability of geolocation models as the models cannot make out a definite position by depth and temperature if these variables are roughly constant throughout the area).

<!-- •	In this study: small sample size plus low retrieval rate of DST  only limited overlap between information gathered from acoustic and dst data -->
<!-- •	General: high potential to gain in-depth insights about horizontal and vertical behaviour on different temporal scales  well-suited tracking method for M. asterias -->
<!-- •	Acoustic detections improve geolocation modelling which is especially helpful in highly mixed areas with homogeneous bathymetry like the Schelde estuary, since these are areas that where geolocation models are less reliable since they cannot make out a definite position by depth and temperature if these variables are more or less constant throughout the area. -->

### Limits and biases of the telemetry methods used

In the following section, shortcomings of the telemetry technologies and the resulting datasets will be discussed.

### Tag recoveries and possible tagging effects {#sec-disc-tagging-effects}

Of 30 deployed ADST, 9 were recovered so far, with data availability of 8 ADST at the time of writing. Out of those, 6 *M. asterias* died within the first month post-release.
There are numerous factors that potentially contribute to a negative effect of the tagging procedure.
For instance, the choice of tag to implant must be made considering the animal’s body mass. Generally, it is advised that the tag should not exceed 10 % of the individuals’s body mass [@wagner_2011]. In the present study, weight was recorded for 17 out of 30 individuals tagged. The lightest individual of those sharks weighed 900 g, resulting in a tag-to-bodymass ratio of 1.4 % and thereby being well under the proposed threshold of 10 %. 
<!-- However, little information on tagging effects on elasmobranchs is available.  -->
In addition, @smukall_2019 report the non-lethal recovery of an acoustic tag 13 years post-release, implanted into a female Lemon shark (*Negaprion brevirostris*) at 119 cm TL. Thus, it does not seem likely that the tag’s weight had a severe negative influence on the survival of the tagged individuals.
Other possible factors include insufficient asepsis of surgery tools and the tags itself, or negative physiological responses due to insufficient handling [@rub_2014]. This includes too much time outside of the water, injuries from the fishing method (hook and line, in this case), or the tag implantation taking too long.

The cause of death for the the 6 *M. asterias* individuals cannot be identified at this point.
<!-- , but it is suggested to always ensure optimal handling, choice of tag, and surgery procedures to ensure good survival conditions of the tagged animals. -->
Death due to predation by an endothermic mammal predator such as the grey seal can be excluded, because the temperature did not substantially rise (to around 38°C, @austin_2006) prior to the animals’ deaths (all raw depth an temperature logs are shown in @fig-dsttempannex. Generally, the temperature logs of the short term DST appear erroneous, note for example that the temperature remains 21.2°C for tag 319 at all time between August 4 and 12, 2018. The possibility of predation by an ectothermic predator cannot be ruled out at this point, since temperature cannot provide any relevant insights but instead the depthlog would show extraordinary vertical movement [see @seitz_2019 for examples of predation by endothermic versus ectothermic predators]. The possibility of predation by an ectothermic animal such as the blue shark *Prionace glauca* could be a next investigative step.

<!-- % - 5% tag to body weight ratio. study by brown and japsen (or sth), eels and cyprinid are more robust  pieterjan, here ratio max 1.4% so from the study's point of view, the sharks should it have taken alright 
<!-- **effect: as soon as you do any observation on animals, you interfere with the system -->
<!--  that means: all tagging has an effect** discuss -->
<!-- ###	Possible death reasons of short term dst’s -->
<!-- -	Tagging consequences -->
<!-- -	High sensitivity (verhelst, pers. Comm.) -->
<!-- -	Not likely: death bc of seals (no temp increase) -->
<!-- -	Laying dead on seafloor (tidal signal) -->

### Limits of the datasets

Essentially, two type of dataset were used for study: Firstly, the acoustic detections of the tagged sharks, and secondly, the DST logs from recovered tags.
<!-- Both datasets entail limitations which will be briefly discussed here. -->

The 10,940 acoustic detections of 18 *M. asterias* individuals over a period of roughly two years are already a relevant dataset to start with, but more tagging effort and thus more acoustic detections are needed to gain further insights into the presence of the species in the Scheldt Estuary.  For comparison, @hereu_2023 tagged 33 European seabass (*Dicentrarchus labrax*), a seasonally migratory fish [@pawson_2007], and had 493.817 acoustic detections over roughly 2 years in an acoustic receiver network comprised of around 100 receivers [@aspillaga_2017]. 
The substantial difference in acoustic detections (approximately factor 50) indicates a difference in explanatory power between the dataset of *M. asterias* and the dataset used in @hereu_2023.

Moreover, the gate-like receiver setup in the Western Scheldt is not ideal to study horizontal distribution but rather serves to detect animals that enter or leave the river Scheldt [@reubens_2019]. If possible, additional receivers could be placed along the coast between Dishoek and Zoetelande to further resolve the seasonal presence of adult females in the area and potentially gain information on pupping grounds.

The availability of only long term DST logs (that is, a log with more than a year of data) poses the greatest limit on the archival dataset. More logs showing the annual migration should be analysed in the future to assess whether the sex-specific patterns described in this study are due to variation between individuals or due to the animal’s sex. The short term DST logs were not further investigated in the present study since altered behaviour resulting from the tagging procedure could not be excluded. However, investigating the short term DST logs could be valuable to assess in the future.

An additional restriction of the archival data is the limit of the depth sensor of 68 m. Since the female shark swam deeper than that limit between October and December, 2018, limited inferences can be made from the female’s depthlog during that period and the current results from the geolocation modelling are therefor imprecise during that time period.

<!-- • There are ~10 000 detections within ~2 yrs but compared to other studies (ref to other studies!) this is not that much.  -->
<!-- • the horiz resolution of receivers, esp in/around the WS is not good bc rather receiver gate than array to monitor species swimming into/out of the Scheldt river (= different use case scenario: receiver array needed to resolve locations of sharks better, and to e.g. enable triangulation) 5.8. Limits of the data storage tag dataset  -->
<!-- • Female shark: deeper than tag depth limit (68m): geolocation model inaccurate, shark putatively went into the Hurd deep (MRGID: 3321) in English channel  -->
<!-- • Only one individual per sex: not reliable, no statistics possible -->

## Reflection of the chosen analyses

Since this work did not involve data collection but instead was purely focused on the analysis of the acoustic detection and data storage tag datasets, the chosen analyses will be reflected upon in the following.

### Acoustic detections

For this work, the acoustic detection data were analysed in an exploratory way. Heatmaps with the number of detections per receiver station, individual and month proved to be a suitable method of investigation.
In the future, the detections of single females during summer could be looked at in detail to assess if there are differences in presence around certain receivers that could indicate pupping.
A useful piece of information for such investigations would be to assess the reproductive status of tagged females (i.e., if the individual is pregnant or not) upon release, as argued in @sec-disc-seasonalpresencefemales.

#### Autocorrelation

<!-- See chapter 5.4.1 of LP_thesis_manuscript_20230504.pdf (without the plots) -->

Autocorrelation analysis allows for a simplistic description of scales of patterns found in time series. It is a helpful exploratory tool to get an overview of the dataset [@dray_2010] and it moreover can provide the base for the detection of behavioural switches [@gurarie_2016]. 
While autocorrelation might not be the most resultful exploratory analysis it can be a helpful auxiliary tool to explore the depth time series data and potentially confirm identified periods with occurring behavioural switches. 
<!-- Although not very common in the analysis of ecological time series, insights on the seasonal scale of vertical movement patterns from this study show its potential. -->

<!--  The characteristics of the autocorrelations of the two long term depthlogs in the present study show similar patterns in time series between the female shark (tag 308) and the male shark (tag 321), indicating that their daily median depth is very similar in time periods of 3 - 5 weeks (that is, with lags below 24 to 35 days). Interestingly, both individuals show turning points in their autocorrelation (i.e., the autocorrelation goes from positive to negative values) at similar lag values, suggesting similar seasonal depth patterns. Furthermore, the local autocorrelation maximum is at similar lag days of about a year for both individuals, indicating an annual pattern in vertical behaviour.  It does not allow for an in-depth investigation of behavioural switches and is generally regarded as a first-hand exploratory analysis. Autocorrelation is a very basic exploratory analysis method used, amongst others, to determine the scale of patterns in time series data. In the present study an annual pattern for both long term DST could be seen [see @sec-resacf and @sec-disc-dst-movementpatterns], as both for tag 308 and 321 the autocorrelation reached a local maximum at a lag of around 10 – 12 months. Going further, the minimum of the autocorrelation occurs in winter. Thus, autocorrelation is a useful method to check if the assumptions about general vertical patterns (in the present case, the same vertical behaviour (resulting in a local autocorrelation maximum) every summer and a different behaviour (resulting in a local minimum) in winter). Potentially interesting are the points at which the autocorrelation is 0. This is the case at a lag (*insert exact lags and dates here*). It might be indicative of a behavioural switch. But this would only hold true in the case of behaviours that can be distinguishable from the depthlog. -->

<!-- overlay identified change periods with diff. step percentages and do `rgrid.arrange(p_acf_308, p_308_ribbon_rulsif_allpercent, ncol = 1)` and see where autocorrelation = 0 and the identified change periods match. -->
### Wavelet Analysis

Conducting a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and thereby resolving prevalent periodicities in the time domain proved to be a main analysis tool in this study. Furthermore, performing CWT both on the raw depthlog and the daily summary statistics allowed for different scales of periodicities and was able to provide further proof of patterns that could already been seen in the daily summary statistics in @fig-dstsum308-1 and @fig-dstsum321-1. Wavelet analysis is no ubiquitous analysis tool in movement ecology but has been employed in the past [@wittemyer_2008; @zhang_2020].
CWT was preferred over Fourier Transformation (FT) due to its ability to resolve periodicities in the time domain. While FT can also be performed on subsets of the depthlog, this manual separation introduces a bias and within that subset, the periodicities are not resolved in the time domain.
The resolution in the time domain of CWT comes at the cost of a lower resolution both in the time and frequency domain. Thus, FT provides a first step of spectral analysis and can give insights into generally existing patterns of periodicity (as shown in **Annex A**), but CWT allows for unbiased assessment of change of prevalent periodicities in time of time series data.
In the wavelet scalograms on the hourly scale, only periods in winter were significantly present and are shown as fully opaque in the plots (@fig-waveletresults308-1 and @fig-waveletresults321-1). In summer, periodicities of 12 h for the female shark and 24 h of the male shark have a high prevalence (indicated by a high power value and an orange/red colour in the scalogram), albeit these are not significant. This is thought to be due to the difference in magnitude of the periodicity during summer compared to the winter period, for example, where overall vertical activity is much higher. 

<!-- So, although not unmistakeably discriminable from white noise, -->
<!-- Compared to Fourier Transformation, Wavelet transform  -->
<!-- •	Very useful method to resolve periodicities in the time domain, can give many insights and confirm patterns visible in the daily summaries but more accurately -->

# Conclusion 

<!-- The data gathered for this study support previous hypothesis about M. asterias seasonal distribution and migration behaviour, and can add more detailed knowledge in some aspects -->

This study presents the first in-depth investigation of both the seasonality of vertical behaviour throughout the annual movement cycle and the presence of *M. asterias* in the Western Scheldt. Adding to already existing knowledge, the seasonal presence of mostly adult female starry smooth-hounds around the Western Scheldt could be confirmed, proving the importance of the area as a summer habitat.
<!-- and further indicating a potential pupping ground (presumably around the receiver station OG10. -->
Moreover, the high return rates provide of individuals into the Western Scheldt further evidence for philopatric behaviour of the species. Although males and females most likely overwinter in different areas [@breve_2016; @griffiths_2020], their seasonal vertical movement behaviour appears to be similar (involving generally less vertical activity during summer and higher vertical activity during winter), according to the two DST tags that were subject of this study. During summers, the female primarily showed resting behaviour while the male exhibited both resting and feeding behaviour, indicating sex-specificity in behavioural states on a within-season scale. During winter, the female’s  (and to a lesser extent, the male’s) vertical activity is potentially influenced by the moon phase which might be linked to the intensity of tidal currents. 
Thus, this study could gain new insights into the seasonal distribution and potential sex-specificity of horizontal and vertical movement behaviour of *Mustelus asterias*. There still is, however, a substantial knowledge gap about the effects of sex and life stage on the species’ distribution [@griffiths_2020] and to be able to establish a successful species management plan in the future, further studies are needed [@mccullyphillips_2015; @breve_2016; @breve_2020; @griffiths_2020].

<!-- •	Previous Knowledge: Females tend to be in the Schelde estuary in summer, potentially related to parturition -->
<!-- o	Knowledge gathered from this study: Females are particularly present around the receiver OG10, and their aggregation might extend to Zoetelande (according to fishermen) -->
<!-- •	Previous knowledge: Migration behaviour is sex specific, with females primarily going southwards during winter and males primarily going northwards -->
<!-- o	Knowledge gathered from this study: the 2 geolocation model outputs show this trend as well -->
<!-- o	Knowledge gathered from this study: New insights on sex- and season-specific vertical behaviour could be gained: females rest during summer, while males also feed, females show a strong biweekly vertical activity periodicity during winter (males less so), the female potentially does not feed during the summer migration -->


# Outlook

## Tagging studies involving *M. asterias*

As discussed in @sec-disc-seasonalpresencefemales, an insightful addition to future tagging studies involving adult *M. asterias* would be to assess the females' reproductive stage upon sampling. This could be done either through ultrasonography or the use of sex steroid hormones [@awruch_2014; @smukall_2019; @anderson_2018; @fujinami_2020; @fujinami_2021]. A new tagging technology was launched recently: The Birth Alert Tag [BAT, @sulikowski_2023], which is, however, only advised to be used on “large sharks”. If smaller BATs are developed in the future, this might be a suitable tag to use on *M. asterias*.
In addition, the placement of an acoustic receiver off the coast of Zoetelande might give further insights into possible seasonal aggregation of *M. asterias* in summer, as described by fishermen[^3].
If possible, DST with a wider depth range should be utilized for future studies, since evidence of *M. asterias* swimming in deeper waters (> 100 m depth) than previously thought is increasing [@ices_2019; @griffiths_2020]. 
Generally, the effect of the implantation of tags on the sharks should be investigated. Since female *M. asterias* have been previously reported to abort and expel embryos when caught [@farrell_2010a], special attention should be drawn to the tagging effect on pregnant females, especially when intending to study their pupping behaviour.

<!-- •	If possible, install receiver at buoy in zoetelande -->
<!-- •	Assess the impact of tagging on pregnant sharks: can sharks abort pups/release them earlier than originally intended due to stress caused by tagging? -->
<!-- •	Use tags for M. asterias that can log deeper than 68m, since the female went past this depth limit -->

## Analysis of data storage tag logs

The adequate analysis of DST logs and the development of well-performing geolocation models remains a challenge. 
While the input of behavioural states (i.e., high or low vertical activity, or residential versus migrating behaviour) would provide improved input for a geolocation model, segmenting the depthlog in different behavioural states is not trivial. 

As a first step to improve the geolocation model without adding behavioural states could be the addition of a simple boundary condition that reflects the demersal lifestyle of *M. asterias*. This boundary condition entails that the maximum depth logged by the tag each day (given that the resolution of the geolocation model is in the unit of days) is equal to the maximum depth of the seafloor at the location of the shark. This would prevent model outputs that estimate the individual’s position on a day at locations with substantially deeper seafloor depth than the shark’s depthlog has recorded that day.

Furthermore, wavelet analysis proved to be a helpful tool for assessing the seasonal changes in spectral composition of the depth signal for both individuals. This technique is suggested to be further taken into account in the future, for instance regarding the segmentation of the depthlog into different behavioural states [as already shown by @soleymani_2017]. Since the implementation of simple CWT in this study is still an exploratory technique it should be investigated how it could be quantified in the future. If different behavioural states, for example resting, feeding and migrating can be linked to specific spectral signatures (i.e., a 12 h period for resting, a 24 h period for feeding and high prevalence of periods from 4h to 64 h for migrating), then wavelet coherence could be a next analysis step. This analysis assesses the similarity of two wavelet scalograms [@grinsted_2004]. Conducting wavelet coherence between the raw depthlogs of the sharks and characteristic spectral signatures of different behaviours could quantify the presence of different behavioural states in the future. Several methods to quantify behavioural states exist already [@pedersen_2008; @heerah_2017] but there is not one generic method that works for all species equally. Thus, it would be valuable to test the method suggested here and compare it to outputs from already existing methods. This would be a next step towards improving the geolocation modelling for *M. asterias* and consequently, our knowledge and understanding of the species.

This work was supported by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) as part of the Belgian contribution to LifeWatch. I am indebted to everyone involved in the tagging of the 30 starry smooth-hounds in 2018 and 2019 without whom this study would not have been possible. My gratitude extends to everyone involved in the maintenance of the acoustic receiver network involved in this study. Furthermore, I appreciate the effort by everyone involved in the return of the tags, enabling me to study the annual vertical movement of the starry smooth-hounds in the first place. I am thankful to the Flemish Marine Institute (VLIZ) for having granted me the opportunity to conduct my master thesis with them, and the IMBRSea coordinators for their continuous effort to make this study programme happen.

I wish to express my heartfelt thanks to my promotors Jan Reubens and Niels Brevé, and my supervisor Carlota Muñiz. Thank you Jan, for providing me with constructive and valuable feedback, thank you Niels for your invaluable input on the starry smooth-hound, and thank you Carlota for guiding me and looking after me when I was a bit stuck.
Furthermore, I am grateful for having been able to go out into the Belgian Part of the North Sea for receiver maintenance work, this experience gave me valuable insights into the practicalities behind the receiver network.
My sincere appreciation goes to Pieterjan Verhelst, for taking me along the Twaite Shad tagging campaign and the car conversations about fish migrations and fishermen’s knowledge. Thank you to Jolien Goossens for carrying out the geolocation modelling of the returned tags which provided an important base for me to follow up on.

I furthermore wish to thank my IMBRSea study mates for productive co-working sessions and emotional support throughout the thesis. My thesis would not have been the same without all the warmhearted colleagues at VLIZ, thank you all for this extraordinary time in Gent and Ostend. 
My eternal gratitude goes to the people that I deeply care for, especially Silvi and Tobi, for emotional support and understanding during this intense period.
And lastly, endless thanks to my parents for being there and supporting me no matter what.

### **A.2** Fast Fourier Transformation {-}

The resulting periodograms from the Fast Fourier Transform for tags 308
(*f*) and 321 (*m*) are depicted in @fig-fft.

<!-- The periodogram of tag 308 (female, see @fig-fft-) has more peaks than -->
<!-- that of tag 321 (male, see @fig-fft-2). The male mostly shows tidal -->
<!-- periods (6, 12 and 24 hours), suggesting selective tidal stream -->
<!-- transport as a driver for movement (*ref*). The use of tidal currents is -->
<!-- well-known in benthic species, especially flatfish, but might also occur -->
<!-- in demersal species like *M. asterias* (*ref*). Tag 308 (f) shows more -->
<!-- peaks outside of potentially tide-related vertical movement behaviour, -->
<!-- i.e., also peaks at 8, 23 and 25 hours. Since all of those periods are -->
<!-- very close to tidal periods and their spectral density not very high it -->
<!-- is unclear at this point if these peaks are because of artefacts during -->
<!-- implementation of the fft-algorithm, or because the female showed -->
<!-- different vertical behaviour than the male. Another possible reason -->
<!-- could be the depth use of the female beyond the sensor range, i.e., in -->
<!-- waters deeper than 68 m and the resulting measurement errors in the -->
<!-- signal of continuous periods of 68 m depth. -->

<!-- In @fig-fft-1, the highest spectral density is at 24 hours, with smaller peaks at 23, 12 and 6 hours. -->
@fig-fft-1 shows spectral density peaks at
about 12 hours (highest), 24 hours, and smaller peaks at 23, 26, 6 and 8
hours. Tag 321 has the highest spectral density at 24 hours, then 12
hours, and small peaks at 6, 23, 25 and 25 hours, see @fig-fft-2.
