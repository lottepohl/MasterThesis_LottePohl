# Questions to Jan, Niels and Carlota {#sec-questions}

## active or passive writing

active or passive style of writing? I learned to write passively but I see a lot of active writing in literature (i.e. we did this instead of this was done)

## how to include geolocation model output {#sec-questiongeolocation}

how should I include the geolocation model output of tag 308 and 321? It is not sth that I did, so it should not go in my results. Thus, intro? and how? It would be nice to show a map and underneath the raw depth- and temperature log. But these logs are kind of a result, and I want to put the raw plots in my results section to build up on that. But then I have sth similar both in the intro and the results? I cannot do that..

## results structure {#sec_questionresultstructure}

How do I structure my results best? I am indecisive between making 1 big figure per tag containing the raw depth and temp log, the autocorrelation plot, the fft periodogram and the daily summary statistics&vertical movement. In my eyes, this makes the most sense since then you have all result plots at once for each tag, but it also is a lot of information and might be overwhelming. The alternative would be to make subchapters for `daily summaries`, `fft`, `raw depthlogs` etc and plot all plots from the same category for each tag. What do you think would be best?

## study area definition {#sec-questionstudyarea}

I have trouble defining the study area: is the study area the BPNS and the Scheldt, because there sharks were tagged? What are the greater north sea and the english channel for the study, as sharks putatively moved there during migration?
I find it important to introduce those habitats as well, because in the discussion I want to talk about food availability and living conditions in the english channel & northern north sea to relate to the putative migration paths. But it also gets long in the methods to describe all 4 areas: the BPNS, the Scheldt Estuary

<!-- ## linear model -->

<!-- Do you think that a linear model trying to relate daily summary statistics to identified migration behaviour could make sense. Having the behavioural state (migratory/resident) as dependent variable, and then trying daily median/max/min, but also the vertical migration behaviour, the most prominent periods and maybe even things like the temperature range as independent variables? -->

<!-- ## working hypotheses {#sec-questionshypotheses} -->

<!-- (How) should I include working hypotheses? -->

<!-- I feel like the structure of the data does not really allow for hypotheses to be made, but maybe I am too cautious. In @sec-introaims I try to define some hypotheses but please let me know if this makes sense at all or not. -->

## maps {#sec-questionsmaps}

I know that I need to improve my maps and make them more readable and understandable. I think I will do my maps in ggplot as opposed to use leaflet. Besides the *To Dos* that I have listed in @sec-mmscheldtBPNS, what would you put in/leave out of the maps?

## acoustic detections analyses {#sec-questionacousticanalyses}

I'm not sure yet which calculations I will include yet. Maybe something concerned with monthly summary statistics. But maybe this also is too much and I should just put the vertical space use analysis and leave out the rest. With the rest I mean things I show here: 
(https://lottepohl.github.io/thesis_docs/20230227_acoustic_data_month_sex/). Maybe though I can try and do a simple ANOVA to compare number of detections per sex and month, for example. What are your ideas?

# Introduction {#sec-intro}

Gathering knowledge on migratory fish species with complex life cycles is challenging, yet necessary to improve management of such species in the future [@brownscombe_2022].
Fish with late reproduction and low offspring numbers such as elasmobranchs are especially vulnerable to anthropogenic effects and require special attention [@stevens_2000].

<!-- ***problem statement: migratory fish, large migrations, management and conservation needed, sharks especially vulnerable, lead to M. asterias.*** -->
An elasmobranch with a complex life cycle involving biannual reproduction and a sex-specific annual migration is the starry smooth-hound shark *Mustelus asterias* (Cloquet, 1819), a demersal triakid shark widely distributed in the Northeast Atlantic [@breve_2016; @griffiths_2020]. Commercial interest and landings have shifted from the recently protected *Squalus acanthias* to *M. asterias* in the past decade [@mccullyphillips_2015], leading to a decreasing population trend [@ices_2022, status: *Near Threatened*]. 
<!-- o	One such species is the starry smooth-hound Mustelus asterias (+ 1-2 sentences about the species) -->
<!-- 	Demersal triakid shark (IUCN: near threatened, decreasing population trend) with broad distribution in the NE atlantic and a complex life cycle involving biannual reproduction and a sex-specific annual migration -->
<!-- 	Refer to subchapter about M. asterias (with more in-depth info) -->
Meanwhile, knowledge about the seasonal presence of *M. asterias* in the Belgian Part of the North Sea (BPNS) and especially the estuary of the Western Scheldt was almost non-existent[^1]. In Dutch coastal waters, this species was almost never caught until 2009 [@breve_2016]. @breve_2016 hypothesize that *M. asterias* might increasingly use the Scheldt estuary because of changing environmental conditions in former habitats due to climate change (i.e., change of pH, eutrophication and differing water temperatures).
   
  [^1]: Reubens, Jan (*personal communication*), May 09, 2023.
  
<!-- o	Until recently, close to nothing about the seasonal presence of M. asterias in the Belgian Part of the North Sea and especially the Scheldt Estuary was known -->
<!-- o	But catches are increasing, alongside the species’ commervial value (Griffiths et al., 2002 and ICES, 2017) -->
<!-- o	Advanced technology is required to follow the movements of demersal, migratory species (transition to telemetry and ADST)  -->

Tracking the movement and presence of migratory aquatic species requires advanced technologies which have improved substantially in recent years [@whoriskey_2019]. 


##	Acquatic telemetry

<!-- ***Overview of the field of acoustic telemetry, popular methods and the resulting dataset structure*** -->

Telemetry refers to the remote monitoring of animals using electronic transmitters or tags,	and receivers [@whoriskey_2019], allowing for the  tracking of marine animal movement. A multitude of telemetry methods exists today, popular technologies to study acquatic animals include acoustic telemetry and archival telemetry [@thorstad_2013].
<!-- satellite telemetry,  -->
Telemetry enables the quantification of animal migrations and (vertical and horizontal) habitat use [@hussey_2015], which informs species management and conservation spanning in marine, freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems [@beger_2010].

<!-- Satellite telemetry involves satellites that receive signals from a tag attached to animal, requiring the tag to breach the water surface for signal transmission (**ref**). -->

Acoustic telemetry refers to the use of acoustic receivers that are placed in the water column which can detect acoustic signals emitted from a tag within a certain range. Such networks exist primarily in shallow, coastal areas of countries with sufficient financial resources to maintain the receivers [@hussey_2015]. Examples include the Acoustic Tracking Array Platform (ATAP) in South Africa [@cowley_2017] and the Permanent Belgian Acoustic Receiver Network [PBARN, @reubens_2019]. 

<!-- maybe include: Recently,	 a	shift	 from	 mobile	 tracking	 towards	 using	 fixed	 receiving	stations	that	automatically	log	detections	has	led	to	a	large	number	 of	tagged	animals	and	extensive	receiver	coverage	crossing	geopolitical	boundaries	 (Donaldson	 et	al.,	2014). from whoriskey 2017 -->

Archival telemetry uses tags or biologgers that locally store recorded data about water pressure, temperature and other environmental variables. Popup Satellite Archival Tags (PSAT) disattach from the animal and float to the surface, transmitting recorded data to satellites, while Data Storage Tags (DST) require the retrieval of the tag for downloading data [@thorstad_2013].

Acoustic data storage tags (ADST) are a combination tag, merging acoustic and data storage tags [@goossens_2023]. As such, the tag emits unique acoustic signals that can be detected by an acoustic receiver within a certain range, and additionally records water pressure in predefined intervals.
<!-- The advantage of ADST lies in the combination of  -->
ADST gather data on horizontal fish movement inside acoustic receiver networks while simultaneously collecting fine-scale vertical movement data that can be used to infer movement of the fish beyond the receiver array.
<!-- •	State advantage of ADST: gathering knowledge on horizontal movement within areas of acoustic receiver array, and additionally gaining fine-scale data beyond those receiver areas to investigate movement and migrations outside the receiver areas -->

Different telemetry methods result in different datasets. 
In acoustic telemetry, recorded data contains the time that a specific tag was detected by a specific receiver (with a known location), resulting in an irregular time series (i.e., a time series with irregularly spaced observations). These datasets are in a horizontal dimension, i.e., with a latitude and longitude position.

Archival telemetry generates regular time series in pre-defined intervals, logging water depth (most importantly) and other environmental variables. These datasets are in a vertical dimension, spanning the depth range of the waters the animal moves in.

ADST datasets contain timestamps of the tag's detection at a specific acoustic receiver, and, in case the tag was recovered, logs of water depth and other variables (temperature, for example).

<!-- ###	Geolocation modelling -->

<!-- ***see @sec-questiongeolocation.*** -->

Stochastic geolocation models are a common method to infer the latitude and longitude (i.e., the horizontal dimension) of a DST log (which is in a vertical dimension).
These models use the seafloor bathymetry in combination with other environmental variables such as temperature to estimate the most likely path that was taken by the animal [@nielsen_2004; @gatti_2021]. 

@pedersen_2008 introduced a geolocation model for a demersal fish species using Hidden Markov Models (HMM), which was refined by @woillez_2016. This model framework was applied to DST data from *M. asterias* individuals [see @goossens_2023, the geolocation results for one female and one male shark are shown in @fig-mapgeolocation].
<!-- The method by @woillez_2016 involves a HMM with two sub-models  an observation and a behavioural model. --> 


<!-- ##### Geolocation Model Results -->

<!-- @goossens_2023 used a geolocation model approach with a two-state HMM following the geolocation approach by @woillez_2016. The inferred daily locations of two *M. asterias* individuals tagged in 2018 are shown in @fig-mapgeolocation. -->

```



<!-- ***go more in depth*** -->

<!-- - Method: HMM with observation and behavioural model -->
<!-- - behavioural switches improve geolocation models significantly [@pedersen_2008]. -->
<!-- *First talk about geolocation modelling in general, and then describe M. asterias behaviours in the chapter about m. asterias, in the aims state that possible improvements of the m. asterias geolocation model exceeding behavioural states will be discussed* -->

<!-- **Where do I put the geolocation results of Jolien? In the introduction or in the discussion? I kind of need to put them in the intro because I am referring to them a lot...** -->

<!-- ## Inferring behavioural states -->


<!-- - Different techniques for behavioural states -->
<!-- - Spectral method by Heerah 2017 -->
<!-- - Tidal method by Pedersen 2008 -->
<!-- - Drawbacks of the methods for species with limited knowledge, a benthic lifestyle with a broad range of horizontal movement -->

In response to their environment and internal ecophysiological processes, animals exhibit different behaviours. The change from one behavioural 'state' to another is referred to as behavioural switching [@gurarie_2016].
Detecting such switches and linking them to environmental factors is an important part of animal movement ecology and can inform species conservation and management [@hays_2016]. 
For species with high economic relevance like European seabass (*Dicentrarchus labrax*), approaches for detecting behaviour of high and low activity have already been developed [@heerah_2017]. Until now, no behavioural segmentation approach exists for *M. asterias*, although the incorporation of behavioural states into geolocation models have shown to improve the model's results [@pedersen_2008].

The raw data storage tag data (i.e., the depth and temperature time series) are ground truth information and their investigation can already give insights into the behaviour of the fish and is therefore relevant information for the protection of that species.

<!-- *change: not inferring behavioural states, but identifying the start of migrations.* -->


<!-- For marine animals equipped with data storage tags, several methods to identify behavioural states have been proposed. These inferred states can be used as additional input for the geolocation model. @pedersen_2008 used tidal patterns to identify resting periods in Atlantic cod *Gadus morhua*, and @heerah_2017 used a combination of spectral analysis (Short Term Fourier Transform STFT) and Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to identify behavioural switches in European seabass *Dicentrarchus labrax*.  -->

<!-- <!-- ***reasons why I didn't use their methods*** --> 

<!-- The method by @pedersen_2008 requires the animal to rest on the seafloor for a certain time period such that a tidal signal is detectable in the depth-time series. @heerah_2017 used STFT which differs from regular Fourier Transformation (FT) by the use of a rolling window, within which the FT is computed.  -->
<!-- The STFT result is then used as input for a HMM framework, which can detect underlying unknown (or *hidden*) behavioural states [@schliehediecks_2012].  -->
<!-- *The choice of window size determines the scale of detected cyclical patterns by the FT, and as such also influence the nature and number of  hidden states detected by the HMM. HMM tend to overestimate the number of hidden states, making it challenging to interpret the detected states from an ecological standpoint. This is especially difficult when information on the behaviour of a species is lacking, or if the species has a large horizontal range of movement.* (***Either put in discussion or leave out, goes too much into detail***) -->

<!-- Furthermore, the development of a robust HMM framework requires time and experience, and was beyond the scope of this study.  -->

<!-- <!-- comparison between marine and terrestrial methods to infer behaviour --> 
<!-- The analysis and segmentation of behavioural states is much more explored for data in the horizontal dimension than in the vertical dimension (*ref*). -->
<!-- Satellite-recorded movement of marine animals can be analysed with a hierarchical Switching State Space Model [SSSM, @francis_2019]. -->
<!-- <!-- For terrestrial animals, the analysis and segmentation of behaviours is much more explored (**ref**).  -->
<!-- Other commonly emplyed methods include Behaviural Change Point Analysis [BCPA, @gurarie_2009] or wavelet decomposition [@soleymani_2017]. Terrestrial animal movement data naturally come in a horizontal domain (i.e., with latitude and longitude) through the ability to use the satellite-based Global Positioning System (GPS). Data storage tags record water pressure (and other variables), and thus the data structure is vertical. The challenge for data storage tags is to infer the horizontal domain (the latitude and longitude over time) from the vertical data (the water pressure over time) as accurately as possible. Since terrestrial animal movement data lack this step, behavioural segmentation methods developed for terrestrial animals cannot directly be applied to marine animal movement data. -->

<!-- ### Change Point Detection -->

<!-- <!-- why I did CPD --> 
<!-- It can be insightful, however, to gather inspiration from terrestrial behaviour segmentation methods. A simpler version of BCPA, for instance, is Change Point Detection (CPD). -->
<!-- <!-- For the present study, a basic version of BCPA was applied to a vertical movement dataset from a demersal shark: Change Point Detection (CPD).  --> -->
<!-- CPD algorithms are designed to detect abrupt changes in signals. An abrupt change occurs very fast compared to the data sampling period, with somewhat constant properties before and after the change [@basseville_1993, pp.1-2]. CPD is a well-explored method in statistics which can also be employed on time series signals [@liu_2013]. -->
<!-- Retrospective (i.e., not real-time) CPD algorithms compare the probability distributions of subsequent samples and a change point occurs when the probability distributions significantly differ.  -->
<!-- CPD detection is an unsupervised machine learning technique that, in contrast to unsupervised clustering algorithms like k-means, compares subsequent samples, thus implementing the time aspect in the learning process. -->
<!-- Details about the CPD algorithm chosen for the present study are explained in @sec-mm_migration. -->

##	The starry smooth-hound shark *Mustelus asterias*

<!-- *put knowledge about the species into context of related species* -->

The starry smooth-hound shark (*Mustelus asterias*, Family: Triakidae) inhabits waters of the Northeast Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea, stretching from the Irish Sea and Central North Sea in the North, to an unknown limit in the south.
 @farrell_2009 confirmed *M. asterias* as the only occurring *Mustelus* species in the Northeast Atlantic following decades of partial misidentification of *M. asterias* as the common smoothhound *Mustelus mustelus* (which occupies warmer waters in the central eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea, @farrell_2015).

<!-- - 1 sentence about the potential of two populations in the greater north sea, and one population going into the Scheldt Estuary in summer [@breve_2016]. -->

*M. asterias* displays circannual and potentially sex-specific migration,
<!-- Annual migration is part of the life cycle of adult *M. asterias*, -->
with females thought to move into the English Channel and the Bay of Biscay in winter, and males moving into the Northern North Sea and into the English Channel [@breve_2020]. Females are known to stay in and around the Scheldt Estuary in summer months.
The *M. asterias* population in the Northeast Atlantic potentially consists of two (or more) sub populations [@breve_2016; @griffiths_2020] that mix on seasonal grounds.

Potential reasons of this sex-specific migration are females avoiding mating, resource competition, or reduction of embryo mortality [@speed_2010].

<!-- also found in other sharks, eg the tope shark (Colloca 2019, from breve 2020) -->

<!-- - Sex bias: Males into Northern North Sea, females into Bay of Biscay -->

<!-- - Daily horizontal distance: up to 70km (**ref!**) -->

*M. asterias* measures around 30 cm in total length (TL) at birth, 100 cm (males) and 120 cm (females) when reaching sexual maturity [@farrell_2010], and can attain up to 140 cm TL [@mccullyphillips_2015]. Sexual maturity is reached at 4-5 and 6 years of age for males and females, respectively, and longevity is 13 years and 18 years for males and females, respectively [@farrell_2010].

<!-- From griffiths 2020: This uncertainty is mainly driven by species identification issues, as morphological similarities between -->
<!-- M. asterias and the common smooth-hound Mustelus mustelus (a separate species that occupies the warmer waters of the central eastern Atlantic, Mediterranean Sea [14, 15] and Black -->
<!-- Sea [16]) have confounded both fishery-independent trawl surveys and commercial catch data -->
<!-- [18]. This misidentification may have led to an over-estimation of the stock’s spatial range for much of the 20th century -->

<!-- ### Reproductive behaviour -->
<!-- *M. asterias* has a complex reproduction behaviour. -->
The species is aplacentally viviparous (i.e. embryos are absorb nutrients from a yolk sack that is used up during gestation). It displays polyandry (i.e., one female mating with several males within one breeding season) and multiple paternity [i.e., pups within one litter originating from several males, @farrell_2014].
Moreover, it has a biennally reproduction cycle with a gestation period of about 12 months, followed by a 12-month resting period. *M. asterias* females can store sperm for up to 12 months [@farrell_2010a]. The same study found embryos from different developmental stages in gestating females (termed embryo asynchronism).
@griffiths_2020 reported philopatric behaviour (i.e., females returning to the same area for parturition) for the first time. 
Identified parturition grounds for *M. asterias* include the Eastern Scheldt and, more generally, the Bristol Channel, Southern North Sea and the English Channel [@dureuil_2013; @mccullyphillips_2015; @breve_2016]. Pupping possibly takes place between April and September [@farrell_2010a; @mccullyphillips_2015].

<!-- ###	Feeding behaviou -->

<!-- IMAGE: starry smooth-hound -->

Its ventrally located snout enables *M. asterias* to feed on prey on the seafloor, indicating that it swims closely above the seafloor during foraging and preying. 
<!-- <!-- [^1]. --> -->

<!--   [^1]: Brevé, Niels (*personal communication*), March 27, 2023. -->

*M. asterias* is a specialist feeder on benthic and suprabenthic crustaceans. Common prey include the hermit crab (*Pagurus bernhardus*), the flying crab (*Liocarcinus holsatus*), the common shore crab (*Carcinus maenas*) and the edible crab (*Cancer pagurus*) [@mccullyphillips_2015; @mccullyphillips_2020]. 
Potential predators of *M. asterias* are the grey seal (*Halichoerus grypus*) which occurs in the North Sea, the blue shark (*Prionace glauca*) and the common dolphin (*Delphinus delphis*), both of which occur in the Western English Channel [@griffiths_2020].

<!-- - Feeding: crustaceans, swimming shorewards at night -->


<!-- ### Daily behaviour -->

<!-- - daily vertical migration: present (find source), but also (most likely) horizontal movement associated with the vertical movement, i.e. the animal stays on the seafloor and swims shorewards during the night, feeding on crustaceans (?) -->

*M. asterias* shows higher vertical activity during night than during the day, indicating prey searching and foraging behaviour at night, which is commonly oberved in elasmobranchs. During the day, it potentially avoids predation by exhibiting resting or sheltering behaviour [@griffiths_2020]. 



<!-- To Do: umschreiben und genauer auf meine studie umformulieren -->
 
###	Research gaps

<!-- #### Relevance of the Study -->
@griffiths_2020 identified seabed association of *M. asterias* as a research gap.
@breve_2020 advised to further research *M. asterias* with a combination of telemetry and genetic techniques.

<!-- #### Migration -->
- sex bias known, but no exact locations, timing also unknown
-	Horizontal and vertical behaviour during migration
<!-- -	Until now, many capture/recapture studies, but no in-depth tracking studies (to our knowledge) -->

<!-- ####	Reproduction -->
- reproductive habitats already studied to some extent, but e.g. parturition site Western Scheldt unconfirmed
  -	General details about parturition: all pups released at once, batches?

<!-- ##	Communication of fish movement ecology studies -->

<!-- *not sure if include at all or not* -->

<!-- ###	Problem -->
<!-- the data is complex and difficult to understand for non-experts, yet it is imperative to communicate the scientific results to transform them into action/change -->

<!-- ###	The quadruple helix -->

<!-- - 	Communication from (fish) scientists to politicians to inform political and fishery management decisions -->
<!-- -	Creating awareness within the general public -->
<!-- -	Information of industry stakeholders, e.g. wind farm companies -->

##	Aims of the work {#sec-introaims}

<!-- *rewrite* -->

The aims of this work are threefold. The first two aims involve DST data, the third aim involves acoustic detections of *M. asterias*:

<!-- Problem here: how do I describe my aims before explaining how many sharks were tagged and how many tags we got back? -->

  1. An ecological description and characterisation of the Data Storage Tag data
  2. The implementation of a simple method to detect behavioural switches in the depthlogs of migrating *M. asterias* individuals, contributing to the improvement of future geolocation modelling of DST data
  3. Description of the acoustic detections of *M. asterias* and the assessment the vertical habitat use of female *M. asterias* just outside of the Western Scheldt during summer.

<!-- Relevant research gaps on *M. asterias* involve the species' sex-biased migration routes and periods. Due to its benthic lifestyle, no satellite tags can be employed, requiring geolocation modelling of Data Storage Tags. Including behavioural states into a geolocation model increases its reliability.  -->
<!-- @goossens_2023 modelled DST data from *M. asterias* without behaviorual switches. The present study implements a simple method to detect change points in a time series signal in order to infer behavioural states from depth time series *M. asterias* that span $\geq$ 365 days. -->

<!-- ### 	Characterizing the vertical behaviour (i.e. the depthlogs) of the migrating sharks -->

<!-- -	Motivation: provide additional input for geolocation models(Behavioural switches) -->
<!-- -	Implement unsupervised learning in the form of Change Point Detection to infer behavioural states/switches = test a new, simple way of inferring behavioural switches. -->

###	Working hypotheses

***Not sure if I should include this at all, I feel like with this kind of dataset it is tricky to state clear and falsifiable hypotheses. What do you say? See @sec-questionshypotheses.***

1. Using Change Point Detection on daily summary statistics successfully identifies putative migration periods, as identified by visual analysis of the raw depthlog.

<!-- ###	Exploratory and descriptive analysis of the female sharks’ vertical behaviour -->

<!-- in the Western Scheldt using the acoustic detections data -->

<!-- -	Sub-dataset of July 2019 since this has the highest density of acoustic detections (~6000 out of ~10000 total detections) -->

<!-- ####	Working hypothesis -->

2. During summer, sharks predominantly use the seafloor section of the space around a receiver
 - predominantly = xx% (or result of chi2?)
 - seafloor section = the deepest 75% around a receiver

<!-- ####	Working hypotheses about the acoustic dataset in general -->

<!-- the seasonal presence of M. asterias is reflected in the acoustic detection dataset -->

3. Already established hypotheses about *M. asterias* behaviour are reflected in the acoustic detections 
 - seasonal presence in the Scheldt estuary (H0 = the mean # detections per month in summer months, here: March – September significantly differs from that in winter months (t-test or Levene test))
 - sex bias, i.e. that females are predominantly present in the Western Scheldt (H0 = number of females detected per month significantly differs from the number of males (t test))

<!-- PLOT (maybe: boxplot, winter vs summer months, detections grouped into months) -->

<!-- the sex bias, i.e. that females are predominantly present in the WS, is reflected in the acoustic detections -->
<!-- -	H0 = number of females detected per month significantly differs from the number of males (t test) -->

<!-- ###	Converting the first results -->
<!-- into a format that transmit relevant messages to one/several groups of non-scientists -->

<!-- **Do not make into aim, too little done in the thesis ** -> move to outlook? -->

<!-- -	No working hypothesis, bc only concept and first draft version, but outlook: further development and then study with people about how well they understood the information provided -->

<!-- State that most of the analyses are descriptive/exploratory bc not much is known about the species yet and the dataset Is a bit too small to perform real statistical tests on -->


# Materials and Methods {#sec-mm}

<!-- contains the design of the research: e.g. experimental design, area description, sampling methods, analysis methods, statistical design and methods -->

<!-- ## Acoustic Tags -->

The *M. asterias* individuals were equipped with *Innovasea* ADST-V13TP tags (Innovasea Ltd., Boston, MA, USA), measuring 46 mm in length and weighing 13 g. Each tag had an estimated battery lifetime of 518 days, and contained a pressure and a temperature sensor with logging intervals of 120 s and 240 s, respectively. For each acoustic detection, a pressure or temperature value was transmitted with a ratio of 1:3 (pressure:temperature). Further details about the tags can be found in the Supporting Information of @goossens_2023.
<!-- reference to innovasea product manual -->
The pressure sensors recorded with a resolution of 0.3 m and an accuracy of $\pm$ 3.4 m until the depth of 68 m, according to the manufacturer (*ref to Innovasea product manual*).

## Tagging Procedure

```{r sum-tagging}
tagging_info <- masterias_info %>% mutate(date = release_date_time %>% lubridate::date(),                        release_loc = ifelse(release_latitude > 51.53, "Neeltje Jans", "outside WS")) %>% group_by(date) %>% reframe(n = n(), release_loc = release_loc %>% unique()) %>% mutate(date2 = date %>% format(format = "%B %d"))

# tagging_info %>% View()
```

Tagged animals were both caught and released in two locations, just west of *Neeltje Jans* (all individuals tagged in July, both 2018 and 2019), and outside the mouth of the Western Scheldt (all individuals tagged in August 2018). The tagging locations are listed in @tbl-releaseloc.
<!-- The two locations are shown in @fig-map_detail. -->

```{r prepare-releaseloc}
release_locations  <- release_locations  %>% 
  rename(`release location` = release_loc,
         `Latitude` = lat,
         `Longitude` = lng)
```


```{r table-animalinfo}
#| include: true
#| label: tbl-releaseloc
#| out-width: 90%
#| tbl-cap-location: top
#| tbl-cap: "Tagging locations. All sharks were tagged within a radius of 2 km of the tagging locations."

knitr::kable(release_locations) %>% kableExtra::kable_styling(position = "center", latex_options = "HOLD_position")
```


Animals were caught using line fishing or handline. After capture, each animal was placed in a holding tank filled with sea water. Before the surgery the animals were turned with the ventral side facing upwards to induce tonic immobility [@kessel_2015] and the midventral line was incised 2-3 cm with a scalpel. Next, the Acoustic Data Storage Tag was inserted into the abdominal cavity with forceps, and the incision was closed with 2-3 stitches of non-absorbable mono-filament [@goossens_2023].

***see @sec-questionstudyarea. Right now it seems I talk a lot about the BPNS, the Scheldt and the English Channel. But in the discussion I want to talk about the characteristics of these habitats and why it would make sense for *M. asterias* to be at one of these places during a specific season (judging from food abundance, abiotic environmental conditions etc.), so I feel like I need to describe these areas first. What do you say: is the level of elaboration okay or do I talk too much in @sec-mmscheldtBPNS and @sec-mmstudyareaec?***

###	The BPNS and Scheldt Estuary {#sec-mmscheldtBPNS}

The Belgian Part of the North Sea (BPNS) is generally characterised by shallow water depths below 40 m [@thierry_2019], sandy or muddy sediment [@wolff_1973; @vasquez_2021] and multiple sandbanks and troughs. 
Artificial structures resulting from human activities, such as shipwrecks and Offshore Wind Farms (OWF), provide hard substrate.
Apart from seafaring and energy production, shipping, fishing (including trawling) or sand and gravel extraction take place in the BPNS [@chen_2005; @douvere_2007]. Furthermore, submarine cables to facilitate energy transport and telecommunication have been present in the North Sea for decades [@degroot_1979].
The river Scheldt meets the North Sea north of the border between the Netherlands and Belgium, forming an Estuary with a complex regime of sandflats and channels [@claessens_1988].
Both the BPNS and the Scheldt Estuary are highly mixed due to strong currents and tides [@otto_1990], introducing saline waters well into the Scheldt Estuary [@ouboter_1998].
The Scheldt Estuary is characterised by medium to coarse sand and salinity between ranges 2 and 33.5 ppt [@baeyens_1998], peaking in summer [@maes_1998]. The seafloor depth averages around 11 m with occasional troughs of up to 20 or 30 m [@thierry_2019]. 
The BPNS and the Scheldt Estuary are influenced by two water bodies [@wolff_1973]: The Channel water and the Continental coastal water. The former is characterised by high salinity (> 18 ppt), low nutrient levels and water temperatures ranging between 6 °C in winter to 16°C in summer. The latter has a lower salinity, has high nutrient levels and a larger temperature range than the Channel water averaging between 3°C in winter and 17°C in summer.

The lower part of the Scheldt Estuary from Vlissingen (The Netherlands) 55-60 km upstream is referred to as Western Scheldt Estuary[@baeyens_1998; @ouboter_1998].
Between Bergen op Zoom and the island Neeltje Jans (both Netherlands), the Estuary is referred to as the Eastern Scheldt Estuary.
An overview map of the BPNS and the Scheldt Estuary is provided in @fig-mapdetail.
Fish and crustacean species composition and abundance underlies strong seasonal patterns, peaking in summer [@maes_1998; @maes_2005]. Seasonally occuring species are marine fish like Atlantic herring (*Clupea harengus*), Sprat (*Sprattus sprattus*) or Whiting (*Merlangius merlangus*), and abundant crustacean species include the common shrimp (*Crangon crangon*) and the palaemonid shrimp [*Palaemon varians*, @maes_1998].

###	The English channel {#sec-mmstudyareaec}

The English Channel (EC) extends from the Dover Strait to England's southwestern tip, spanning 77 000 km^2^ [@dauvin_2012]. The mean seafloor depth increases from around 25 m in the east to 75 m in the west [@dauvin_2012], except for the 174 m deep *Hurd deep*, a trench located close to the channel island Guernsey.
An overview of the English Channel and the North Sea is provided in @fig-mapoverview.
Shipping, fishing and granulate extraction occurs all over the EC region [@dauvin_2015]. Strong tidal currents from west to east are present, which are higher on the French than on the English coast due to Coriolis force, reaching maximum values of 8 knots at the Cap de la Hague [@salomon_1993]. Tidal circulation influences the composition of superficial seafloor sediments with coarse sediments dominating in areas of strong tidal currents and fine and muddy sediments dominating in bays and estuaries with weaker tidal currents as well as on the English Coast [@larsonneur_1982].
From the western end up to Guernsey and the Hurd Deep, stratification occurs in summer, which is broken down as water progresses towards the east, resulting no vertical temperature gradient to be present in the eastern EC [@holme_1966]. Seafloor temperatures vary less in the western EC (range: 9$^\circ$C to 14$^\circ$C) than in the eastern EC (8$^\circ$C and 16$^\circ$C).
Species living on the seafloor include Crustacea like the edible crab (*Cancer pagurus*), the common spider crab (*Maja squinado*), the European lobster (*Homarus gammarus*) and *Upogebia spp.* [@holme_1966; @vaz_2007].

***See @sec-questionsmaps, could you say what you would change about the maps, i.e. what things you would put in/leave out?***

*To Do Map:*

 - put all receiver stations in map (also those further up the river)
 
 - label Dishoek, and station ws-OG10.
 
 - include outlines of the Western and Eastern Scheldt
 
 - include outlines of the French and Dutch EEZ and make one colour for EEZ
 
 - indicate the WS1 and the WS2 array (esp. for vertical space use analysis for acoustic detections)
 
 - in ggplotmap: make depth contours to avoid having so many colours.
 
 - should I include shipwrecks at all? I'm probably not mentioning them really, but it still is interesting to get an idea about the vast amount of shipwrecks in the BPNS and around...

##	The Permanent Belgian Receiver Network

The acoustic receivers of the Permanent Belgian Receiver Network (PBARN) were used in this study. The PBARN is part of the European Tracking Network, which was established in 2017 as a pan-european aquatic telemetry network [@reubens_2019].
As of 2019, the PBARN consisted of 177 permanently installed and monitored acoustic receivers within the BPNS, the Scheldt Estuary, the Dijle, Rupel, Albert Canal and the Meuse River [@reubens_2018].
A detection probability of >50 % was estimated for a radius of 500-700 m around the receiver [@goossens_2022], and >70 % for 200 m radius [@reubens_2018].



<!-- rewrite, from goossens 2016 -->
<!-- The  data  originated  from   6  2     self  -  contained,  single  channe  l  (69  kHz),  submersible     Vemco     acoustic   receivers  . These receivers were attached to buoys and/or   bottom moorings     and were removed either   manually, either with an acoustic release system.   23     acoustic receivers were   deployed     in the BPNS at   spread out position  s and 39 were set up in the Scheldt Estuary in three receiver   array  s. These receivers   were  categorized  into  four  locations,  based  on  their  positions:  offshore,  coast,  Western  and  Eastern   Scheldt  Estuary.  From  July  2014   until   July  2015,  36  fish  were     caught   by  hand  -  line  and     tagged  with  a   Vemco V9  -  1L transmitter with a unique ID, emitting a signal every 110 to 250 seconds     (Vemco 2016)  .

### Data Management

<!-- *change title* -->
 
The database of the European Tracking Network (https://lifewatch.be/etn) stores the acoustic detections, and metadata connected to the animal individuals and the tags used. <!-- make etn link into citation -->
The data storage log files and the outputs of the geolocation models were accessed and management via the Marine Data Archive (MDA, *ref*).

<!-- - *Question: TABLE with lat lon & names of receiver stations?* noooo right? -->

## Ethics statement

The care and use of the animals complied with the Belgian Animal Welfare Act, guidelines and policies as approved by the *Ethische Commissie Dierproeven* (project reference EC2017-080). All animal treatments were undertaken in 2018 and 2019, and all tagging procedures were carried out by competent and trained personal license holders.

##	Data Analysis and visualisation

***I still need to reference all packages used.***

All data analyses were carried out using R [@R_2022], primarily using the packages *'dplyr'* and *'lubridate'*.
<!-- All maps were created using the *'leaflet'*-package.  -->
Geospatial data, where not otherwise indicated, was queried from *marineregions.org* in the case of (marine) boundaries (with the *'mregions2'*-package), and *EMODnet* for human activities data (with the *'EMODnetWFS'*-package). All plots were generated using the *'ggplot2'*-package. Packages used for specific data analyses are indicated in the respective section.
<!-- To Do: name all required packages for an analysis -->

###	Acoustic Detections

Detections were accessed from the ETN database. Tags with only a single detection were omitted from all further analyses.

<!-- ***I'm not sure yet which calculations I will include yet. Maybe something concerned with monthly summary statistics. But maybe this also is too much and I should just put the vertical space use analysis and leave out the rest. With the rest I mean things I show here: (https://lottepohl.github.io/thesis_docs/20230227_acoustic_data_month_sex/)*** -->

***see @sec-questionacousticanalyses for my question about what analyses/calculations would make sense to include.***
Summary statistics describing seasonal shark presence around the receivers in the Western Scheldt were calculated: The number of detections and individuals detected at each receiver, per month (*rephrase*).

<!-- **write: depth use ** -->

<!-- *To compare shark presence around the receivers in the Western Scheldt between seasons, an ANOVA was executed. (**TO DO**)*. -->

#### Vertical space use analysis

To assess the vertical space use of sharks detected in the WS1 and WS2 array, the depths transmitted with the detections were compared to the bathymetry composition around each receiver. 
The acoustic detections from 2019 and in the WS1 and WS2 area were used.
A bathymetry dataset from the Flemish government (publication date: November 18, 2019, *ref*) was used. The dataset has a 1m x 1m resolution and contains the mean depth per grid cell. The seafloor depth within a radius of 200 m around each receiver was extracted using the *'sf'*-package in R. The 200 m refer to the probability of >70% of an acoustic detection [@reubens_2019].
The following was done both for the bathymetry subsets and the acoustic detections for each receiver station in the WS1 array: Firstly, the maximum and minimum depth (of seafloor depth and acoustic detections) around each receiver were extracted, and the percentage of grid cells/detections that contained a depth value within a 10 m depth bin (spanning from 0 m to -50 m) was computed.

###	Data Storage Tags {#sec-mm_dsts}

Depth and temperature logs from the recovered tags were accessed via the Marine Data Archive (MDA).
<!-- TODO: link URL -->
The temperature log was not included in any analysis.
The first week of depth values was excluded from all analyses to remove potential bias resulting from the tagging procedure [cf. @flavio_2021]. The date of death, used to calculate the time at liberty, was visually extracted from plots of the raw depth series, and marks the date after which only a tidal signal remains in the depthlog, which is characterised by cyclically rising and falling depths within a rough 2 m interval.
<!-- Potentially automate this -->

Only depthlogs that logged for $\geq$ 365 days where included in the migration period analyses described below. Those will be referred to as *long term DST depthlogs* in the following.
<!-- maybe rephrase: "excluded from all analyses" -->
Summary statistics (median (since depth did not follow a normal distribution), maximum, minimum depth, and depth range) were calculated per hour, day/night, date, week and month. 
<!-- For all of these calculated summary statistics, the daily change was computed (i.e. * variable~change~ = variable~t~ - variable~t-1~).  -->
For the day/night summaries, sunrise and sunset times were extracted using the *'suncalc'*-package.
<!-- On the daily summaries, a rolling mean with a window size of 3 days was applied to smooth the data. -->
On the daily summaries a Savitzky-Golay smoothing filter [@press_1990, filter order *p = 1*, filter length *n = 5*] was applied using the *'sgolayfilt()'*-function from the *'signal'*-package. This particular filter smoothes the data but retains spikes in the data better than other smoothing filters like butterworth or averaging filters (like rolling mean) 
*(**ref**, example in `sgolayfilt()` documentation)*.
Prior to spectral analyses, the data was centred and normalised, resulting in a mean of 0 and a sd of 1.
<!-- still do!!!! -->
The autocorrelation was calculated using the *`stats::acf()`*-function. Autocorrelation refers to the serial correlation of a data series with itself [@bartlett_1946], resulting in an autocorrelation coefficient between -1 and 1 (0 referring to perfect anti-correlation and 1 referring to perfect correlation, 0 referring to no correlation at all) over the lag, which refers to the overlap between the data series with itself.

<!-- check: sollte ich das noch machen?? -->
<!-- The animal's vertical speed (in *m/min*) was calculated following @griffiths_2020, dividing the depth difference between two consecutive measurements by the time interval (in min). -->


A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was performed on all DST logs, using the *'base::fft()'*-function. This method decomposes a signal in the time domain (which is a combination of multiple sine waves with different frequencies) into its components in the frequency domain. Dominant frequencies (or rather periods, which is the inverse of the frequency) give insights about the scale of periodicity of a signal (in the present case the signal is the depth-timeseries) (*ref*).
<!-- give fft source -->

#### Lunar influences on vertical movement during winter

To investigate the influences of moon phases and possible correlating variables, the illuminated fraction of the moon was calculated using the *`moonAngle()`*-function from the *'oce'* package.
Then, the daily summary statistics were subset with the dates that each individual most likely was in its winter habitat, i.e. during winter and in deeper waters compared to summer. For the female individual (tag 308), the depth data was subset between December 12, 2018 and March 11, 2019, and for the male individual, the depth data was subset between December 09, 2018 and April 30, 2019. Firstly, the median depth was compared between day and night, using a one-sided Wilcoxon Test.
Then, simple linear regression was employed to investigate the relationship between the median depth and the moon phase (represented by the illuminated fraction of the moon). Two kinds of regression models were done. The first model takes as input the median depth per date (thus, not considering day and night). The second model takes as input the median depth per date and day/night, and tests for an interaction effect of the illuminated fraction of the moon and whether or not it is day or night.

#### Migration Period Analysis {#sec-mm_migration}

<!-- **To do: remove rolling mean but instead use sgolay filter for all, p = 1 and n = 5** -->
The following steps were only performed on the tags that logged for >365 days.
<!-- longterm DST logs, that is, tag 1293308 and 1293321. -->

<!-- include function settings for CWT: dt = 1, factor_smallest_scale = 2) -->

Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) was performed on the daily summary statistics of the longterm DST depthlogs, using the *'biwavelet'*-package. In contrast to FFT, this method gives insights into the occurrence of certain frequencies within the time domain. Thus, not only information about the dominant frequencies is gathered, but also when in the time signal those frequencies appear. In order to resolve the components of the frequency domain within the time domain, however, the resolution of both is minimised (following Heisenberg's uncertainty principle). To obtain robust and valid results despite the resolution loss, frequencies were compared against white noise using a $\chi^2$ test. Only frequencies that significantly differed from white noise were incorporated into further analyses (*CWT reference*).
<!-- For the present study, a basic version of BCPA was applied to a vertical movement dataset from a demersal shark: Change Point Detection (CPD).  -->
Finally, daily summary statistics were used to detect abrupt changes in the depth time series, indicating the start of a migration phase. Following @aminikhanghahi_2017, *Relative unconstrained Least-Squares Importance Fitting* [RuLSIF, @liu_2013] is a robust method which is adequate to use with non-stationary (i.e., statistical properties such as the mean, or autocorrelation are non-constant over time) time series data like the dataset at hand. 
RuLSIF is a density-ratio estimation method and, in brief, approximates the dissimilarity of two subsequent time intervals $\chi$ and $\chi'$, using an $\alpha$*-relative Pearson Divergence* (rPE), with $0 < \alpha < 1$. By making the dissimilarity measure relative, the risk of infinite density ratios is circumvented [@liu_2013].

RuLSIF was employed with the *'ts_detect()'*-function from the *'rulsif.ts'*-package [@brubaker_2021]. The algorithm can take an n-dimensional time series as input, as such allowing for more than one calculated summary statistic to be used as input. In this case, the Savitzky-Golay-filtered (see @sec-mm_dsts) daily median depth, maximum and minimum were chosen. These three parameters describe the daily depth use in a basic but overseeable way, making the interpretation of results easier.

Hyperparameters are non-learned settings of a machine learning algorithm that control the learning behaviour during the algorithm's training [@yang_2020].
Several hyperparameters needed to be chosen: the relative parameter $\alpha$, the window size *w*, the number of samples before and after a data point to compare between (*step*), and the threshold of the relative PE score above which a time point is classified as a change point (*thresh*).
Hyperparameters were either chosen based on already established settings (here, $\alpha$ was kept at the function's default of 0.05) of the RuLSIF algorithm, based on ecological properties of the dataset (*w* = 7, because roughly one week long migrations were expected), or logical reasoning (*thresh = 0.95*, higher than the default 0.9, thus requiring the divergence measure (the rPE score) to be relatively high for a point to be classified as a change point). 
As default in *`ts_detect()`*, *step* is set to 10% of the amount of time points in the dataset used, but it is advised to decrease the step if computational resources allow for it [since smaller steps increase computation time, @brubaker_2021]. In the present study, RuLSIF was performed for different values of *step*: 2.5%, 5% and 10% of the input dataset length. For example, the DST 321 logged for 471 days, and a *step* of 5% of the input dataset length would amount to a *step* of 24 (days, rounded to the nearest integer).
To group detected change points into change periods, change points that were less than 7 days apart from each other were classified as the same change period.


<!-- Thirdly, the daily summary statistics and the results from the wavelet analysis (i.e., significantly present periods per day), were used as input for k-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. Unsupervised (as opposed to supervised) learning was utilised in this case because it does not require a training dataset with known right answers (which in this case would be the days that the sharks are migrating). -->
<!-- The algorithm was run n = 100 (**DO!**) times each for a number of clusters from 1 to 8. The optimal number of clusters was identified using the *elbow*-method (**reference**). -->

<!-- Next, FFT was performed on each cluster separately, after the predominant cluster per week was assigned to all data points within that week. The last step was done to smooth the clustering result and reclassify potential outliers. -->
<!-- In addition, CWT was performed on the hourly summary statistics for each cluster. -->

# Results {#sec-results}

## Tagged animals

Tagging of 30 *M. asterias* individuals occured in July and August, 2018 (`r tagging_info$date2[1]`, n = `r tagging_info$n[1]`, `r tagging_info$date2[2]` and 03, n = `r tagging_info$n[2]` and n = `r tagging_info$n[3]`) and in July, 2019 (`r tagging_info$date2[4]` and 12, n = `r tagging_info$n[4]` for both dates).
Details on the tagged individuals are listed in @tbl-animalinfo.
Of the `r tagged_animal_info %>% dplyr::filter(sex == "m") %>% nrow()` males that were tagged and detected >1 times, only `r tagged_animal_info %>% dplyr::filter(sex == "m", n_detect > 1) %>% nrow()` were detected at all. 3 of the detected males were detected in the year following their tagging. 
Of the `r tagged_animal_info %>% dplyr::filter(sex == "f") %>% nrow()` tagged females, `r tagged_animal_info %>% dplyr::filter(sex == "f", n_detect > 1) %>% nrow()` were detected more than once and 11 individuals were detected in the year following their tagging.

## Acoustic detections

Two tags only had a single detection (serial number `r tag_serial_number_omit[1,] %>% dplyr::pull()` and `r tag_serial_number_omit[2,] %>% dplyr::pull()`) and were thus omitted from all further analyses.
The acoustic detections of the remaining tags over time are shown in @fig-abacus. The acoustic detections at each receiver station of female *M. asterias* within the Westerschelde are shown in @fig-heatmapdetections.

Within the study period from August, 2018 to August, 2020, there are no acoustic detections between November and April in either year. `r round((detections_tempdepth_daynight %>% dplyr::filter(area == "WS1") %>% nrow() / detections_tempdepth_daynight %>% nrow()) * 100, digits = 2)` % of detections are in the WS1 area, and of those, `r round((detections_tempdepth_daynight %>% dplyr::filter(station_name == "ws-OG10") %>% nrow()) / (detections_tempdepth_daynight %>% dplyr::filter(area == "WS1") %>% nrow()) * 100, digits = 2)` % are at station *ws-OG10* (see @fig-mapdetail). Of the `r tagged_animal_info %>% dplyr::filter(sex == "m", n_detect > 1) %>% nrow()` detected males, 3 were detected inside the BPNS and one in the WS1 array.

Across all years, most detections (n = 2484) were in the month of May, while most individuals (n = 10) were detected in August.

6 out of 8 recovered tags logged for a month or less, only the tags with the serial numbers 1293308 (f) and 1293321 (m) logged for a year, allowing for the analysis of migration behaviour. These two tags will be referred to as long term DST in the following, and their tag serial numbers will be abbreviated to *308* and *321*. The rest of the tags will be referred to as short term DST. For the short term DST logs, tag 295 will be further discussed. All figures of the tags not included here can be found in @sec-annexdst.

### Raw depth and temperature logs



The depth and temperature logs of tag 308 and 321 (the two long term DST) are shown in @fig-dst308 and @fig-dst321, respectively. 
<!-- The depth logs of the two long term DST are shown in @fig-dst308 and @fig-dst321.  -->
The remaining depth logs are depicted in @sec-annexdst_raw.

### Autocorrelation {#sec-resacf}

The autocorrelation plots of the two long term DST logs are shown in @fig-acf. The variable used for computing the autocorrelation is the Savitztky-Golay filtered daily median depth.
Autocorrelation is above 0.5 at lags below 35 days for tag 308 (f), reaching 0 at lags of 81 and 264 days. The minimum is at 170 days and the local maximum at 300 days, see @fig-acf-1.
High autocorrelation (above 0.5) is attained below lags of 24 days for tag 321 (m). Autocorrelation is 0 at 75, 256 and 383 days and is minimal at a lag of 138 days. A local maximum occurs at 345 days, see @fig-acf-2.

### Summary statistics {#sec-results-dst-summary}

The daily summary statistics of the depthlogs of tags 308 and 321 are displayed in @fig-dstsum.
The black line shows the Savitzky-Golay filtered daily median (not the mean since depth values are not normally distributed). The grey ribbon spans between the Savitzky-Golay filtered daily maximum and minimum depth. 
<!-- The coloured bars represent the vertical movement behaviour per day as classified by a $\chi^2$ test that compares the depths at night to the depths during the day (depth~night~ significantly shallower/deeper than depth~day~: Diel Vertical Migration (DVM)/reverse DVM (rDVM), no significant difference: no DVM (nDVM)). -->

@fig-dstsum-1 displays a daily maximum of about 20 m until end September and then, until the start of October the daily median decreases and reaches 86 m, the maximum depth that the sensor records. Until the beginning of December the shark swims at deep depth, with minimum daily depths not shallower than 50 m. After that until mid March the daily maximum depth is between 40 and 68 m and the daily minimum depth is between 5 and 50 m. After March 19, 2019, the daily median depth is always shallower than 60 m. Between March until the end of the time series, some plateaus in median depth occur: Around 35 m median depth from end March to end April, around 17 m depth from mid May to the start of June and from end July onward, and around 8 m depth between June 11 and July 13, 2019.

## Acoustic detections and depthlog

@fig-adst308 shows the raw depthlog of tag 308, the female shark that logged data for one year, superposed with the acoustic detections of that individual. After the DST had stopped recording on August 03, 2019, the shark was recorded at station OG10. And on October 05, 2019 it was recorded at the Birkenfels station in the BPNS.

<!-- ## Acoustic detections  -->
##	Seasonality of starry smooth-hound presence in the Western Scheldt {#sec-disc-acousticdetections}

There are no acoustic detections at all [cf. @fig-abacus] between November and April in all years with acoustic detections (2018-2020). This indicates a seasonal presence of *M. asterias* in the Western Scheldt between April and November. The months of May and October had the most acoustic detections while most individuals were detected in August. Therefore, it is difficult at this point to narrow down the time window of April until November and it is recommended to study the seasonal presence of *M. asterias* in the Western Scheldt with greater detail in the future.

A hotspot of seasonal presence of mature *M. asterias* females seems to be the receiver OG10 (`r round((detections_tempdepth_daynight %>% dplyr::filter(station_name == "ws-OG10") %>% nrow()) / (detections_tempdepth_daynight %>% nrow()) * 100, digits = 2)` % of detections, and 10 out of 14 detected females). According to fishermen, the area offshore from Zoetelande (north of Dishoek) is a *M. asterias* fishing hotspot, so the coastal waters between Diskoek and Zoetelande are suggested to be important for the species. Whether or not the potential aggregations of mature females is related to parturition cannot be said at this point. 
There are several indications, however, that point towards the Westerschelde and/or its surrounding waters to be a pupping area for *M. asterias*. The Eastern Scheldt is a confirmed pupping ground [@breve_2016], and during the tagging for this study in August, 2018, two neonates [around 30 cm TL, @farrell_2010] were caught [^1].
  
  [^1]: Verhelst, Pieterjan (*personal communication*), April 25, 2023.

Future studies could address the horizontal distribution of female *M. asterias* in summer by placing additional receivers along the coastline between Dishoek and Zoetelande. Currently, the receiver placement of the WS1 and WS2 array (which is in a gate-like manner from north to south) does
not allow for detailed insights in the horizontal distribution. A grid-like receiver array could improve that (see also Section 5.7).

Another important fact to consider is the biannual reproductive cycle of *M. asterias* and whether that implies differing habitat use between years of pregnancy and years without a pregnancy.
In the future, it could be helpful to assess if adult females are pregnant at the time of release, through ultrasonography or the use of sex steroid hormones, both of which have already been employed to determine pregnancy in sharks [@awruch_2014; @anderson_2018; @fujinami_2020; @fujinami_2021]. This would allow for further clarification if the Western Scheldt is used as a pupping ground, and if it might be a relevant area for non-pregnant females, too.

An area with little presence of the tagged *M. asterias* individuals is the Western Scheldt upstream past Vlissingen. Shallow and sheltered coastal habitats are thought to be suitable pupping grounds for sharks in general [@speed_2010] and for *M. asterias* in particular [@ellis_2004; @ ellis_2005]. The low number of acoustically detected sharks (38 detections across the whole study period) indicates that the waters past Vlissingen are not as frequently used as the waters around Dishoek. 
The Scheldt Estuary is influenced by two water bodies from the North Sea, the Channel water and the Continental coastal water [@wolff_1973, see @ sec-mmscheldtBPNS]. The boundary between those bodies is approximately 30 km offshore from the Estuary, and in the Continental coastal waters nutrients are abundant (unlike in the Channel water). This, together with monthly water temperatures above 15 °C between June and September make the (Western) Scheldt Estuary a potentially suitable pupping habitat. The fact that few sharks were detected upstream past Vlissingen could be due to low salinities, or to anthropogenic influences like dredging. This, however, should be further investigated in follow-up studies.
*M. asterias* might leave the area of the Western Scheldt during winter because of decreasing water temperature. Since water temperatures are a main predictor of both teleost and elasmobranch occurrence [@thiel_1995; @martin_2010]. The warmer waters in the Channel area might be favourable especially for gestating females since higher water temperatures increase metabolic rate and thereby improve embryo development [@hurst_1999].
<!-- It was therefore unexpected to have only 38 acoustic detections in the WS2 array which can be considered more sheltered than the WS1 array, and no detection in the WS3 array. This, together with the high numbers of detections in the WS1 array indicates that the waters around the WS1 array are more utilized and thus more relevant for the species as compared to the Western Scheldt estuary upstream past Vlissingen. Possible reasons for the low presence of *M. asterias* can be salinity (the salinity tolerance of the species), limited availability of prey, or water quality. -->


<!-- - If the reason for not being detected is because of tagging mortality or because the individuals left the study area rapidly cannot be inferred at this point. -->
<!-- - in/around Western Scheldt, according to ac. detections -->
<!-- -	Highly seasonal (only in summer) -->
    <!-- Explanation: Abiotic water conditions (salinity and temperature) are often evoked as controls for seasonal patterns of species occurrence ( Thiel et al ., 1995 ), from @maes_1998 -->
<!-- -	Sex-biased (mostly females) -->
<!-- -	Possible pupping area, but this dataset not sufficient to confirm -->

<!-- - interesting to note that temperatures experienced by M. asterias were ~5 degrees at minimum. Interestnig bc Breve 2016 suggested that 13 degree is a threshold for M. asterias presence in dutch coastal waters. -->

<!-- ### Vertical space use analysis {#sec-discvertical} -->

<!-- The results show that for 10 out of 16 stations, deeper waters were utilised by *M. asterias* around a receiver than contained in the bathymetry grid used. This can have several reasons: -->
<!-- 1. The depth per grid cell is the mean depth in that cell, thus deeper depths are present most likely. -->
<!-- 2. The shark was detected within a radius more than 200m away from the receiver, where the water is deeper. -->
<!-- 3. The bathymetry grid does not match the actual conditions in the water at the time of detection, both due to the resolution of the grid and the highly dynamic, sandy environment with high possibility of changing depths. -->

<!-- The 3 stations with deeper maximum bathymetry values than maximum detection depth (4, 11, 13) all are located in the WS2 array, in a trough. It indicates that in this area the sharks don't use the seafloor around the receiver (which is at depths between 15 and 30 m, roughly) but instead are detected in depths between 2 and 7 m.  -->

<!-- Of the 10 stations that showed deeper detection depth than bathymetry, 8 are in the WS1 array. -->

<!-- The 3 stations (PVTSS, GVWSP, W6) where deepest detection depth and deepest bathymetry value overlap all are kind of inside of the channel, not directly at the shoreline. This could mean that ships pass those points frequently.  -->

<!-- For the receiver stations close to the shoreline (DL7, DL9, DL12, borssele, OG10, OGDL) the acoustic detection depth is much deeper than the depth in the bathymetry dataset. This could be because at the shoreline, the bathymetry dataset is less accurate. -->

<!-- ### The Western Scheldt as a pupping ground for *M. asterias* -->

<!-- It is surprising that only very few of the acoustic detections occurred in the WS2 array (`r round((detections_tempdepth_daynight %>% dplyr::filter(area == "WS2") %>% nrow()) / (detections_tempdepth_daynight %>% nrow()) * 100, digits = 2)` %, or `r detections_tempdepth_daynight %>% filter(area == "WS2") %>% nrow()` detections in total), since literature suggests that sharks utilise sheltered estuarine habitats for pupping (*references*). -->
<!-- Instead, `r round((detections_tempdepth_daynight %>% dplyr::filter(station_name == "ws-OG10") %>% nrow()) / (detections_tempdepth_daynight %>% nrow()) * 100, digits = 2)` % of detections were at station *ws-OG10*, which is located at the coast of Dishoek [NL, see @fig-mapdetail]. -->
<!-- Judging from the differences in detections inside and outside the Western Scheldt the question arises if really the Western Scheldt is a pupping ground, or if the pupping ground might instead be located outside of the estuary. -->
<!-- In recent years, fishermen targeting *M. asterias* have focused their fishing activity off the coast of Zoetelande (NL), because catch rates apparently are very high (*ref to per. comm. with Pieterjan and Nico*). Furthermore, during the tagging of the 9 individuals just outside of the Western Scheldt (off the coast of Cadzand, NL), two neonates were caught [around 30 cm TL, @farrell_2010]. -->

<!-- Potential explanations could be that either sharks do not pup in the estuary (anymore), due to increased pollution or less food resources, for example. Or that they stay outside of the estuary and then only go inside the estuary to give birth.  -->
<!-- It would be interesting to investigate the horizontal distribution of female *M. asterias* in summer by placing additional receivers along the coastline of Dishoek and Zoetelande. Currently, the receiver placement of the WS1 and WS2 array (which is in a gate-like manner from north to south) does not allow for detailed insights in the spatial distribution. A grid-like receiver array could improve that (see also @sec-disclimitsacoustic). -->

<!-- Looking at the vertical space use of *M. asterias* females in the WS2 array in 2019, at station 4, 11 and 13, the sharks appear to use the water column instead of the seafloor (as discussed in @sec-discvertical). If this behaviour is related to parturition is not clear, since there is no knowledge about the vertical behaviour of an aplacentally viviparous shark during parturition. This could be a point of further investigation in future studies. -->

##	Tag recoveries

### Tag sensitivity

2% - 5% tag to body weight ratio. study by brown and japsen (or sth), eels and cyprinid are more robust --> pieterjan, here ratio max 1.4% so from the study's point of view, the sharks should it have taken alright

**effect: as soon as you do any observation on animals, you interfere with the system
 that means: all tagging has an effect** discuss

###	Possible death reasons of short term dst’s

-	Tagging consequences
-	High sensitivity (verhelst, pers. Comm.)
-	Not likely: death bc of seals (no temp increase)
-	Laying dead on seafloor (tidal signal)

##	Ecological inferences from migration dataset analysis

- it is tricky to determine what you look for when you don't know that much about the behaviour of the species, e.g. what we woul call migration behaviour is the absence of resting behaviour (which is characterised by resting periods detected as tidal signal in the raw depthlog).

- intensity of dial patterns in different periods for tag 308 and 321
  - e.g. periods of 6 and 12 h stronger present in 308 than 321: what could that mean? different foraging strategy or diet? Literature on sex-specific diet? 
  - read about Selective tidal stream transport benthic fish species (Pieterjan): explanation for tidal patterns in periodograms?

###	Vertical patterns during migration

-	Yes, but eventually swimming inshore
-	How strong are diel patterns in putative migration weeks? Check wavelet median depth

#### lunar influences on winter residency behaviour of tag 308  

- english channel: among the strongest tidal currents in the world
- less activity during full and new moon: neap currents, ie. weaker tidal currents

<!-- from chatCPT, umschreiben: -->
<!-- The English Channel, including the waters around the Channel Islands, experiences some of the strongest tidal currents in the world due to its funnel-like shape and shallow depths. The tidal currents are primarily driven by the gravitational pull of the moon and to a lesser extent, the sun. -->

<!-- Tidal currents in the English Channel and around the Channel Islands can reach speeds of up to 4-5 knots (2-2.5 m/s) during spring tides, when the gravitational pull of the moon and sun are aligned. During neap tides, when the gravitational pull of the moon and sun are perpendicular, the tidal currents are weaker and can reach speeds of around 1-2 knots (0.5-1 m/s). The difference in tidal current speeds between spring and neap tides is particularly pronounced in narrow channels and around islands, where the flow is constricted. -->

<!-- The timing of high and low tides also varies with the lunar cycle, with high tides occurring during the new moon and full moon phases and low tides during the first and third quarter phases. This is because during the new and full moon phases, the gravitational pull of the moon and sun are aligned and reinforce each other, resulting in higher high tides and lower low tides. -->

<!-- The English Channel and the waters around the Channel Islands are also influenced by other factors, such as wind and water temperature, which can affect the strength and direction of the tidal currents. However, the lunar cycle remains the primary driver of tidal currents in the region. -->

## Reflection on the analysis methods used

### Autocorrelation

***ueberarbeiten***

Autocorrelation analysis allows for a simplistic description of scales of patterns found in time series. It is a helpful tool to get an overview over the dataset. It does not allow for an in-depth investigation of behavioural switches and is generally regarded as a first-hand exploratory analysis.

Autocorrelation is a very basic exploratory analysis method used, amongst others, to determine the scale of patterns in time series data. In the present study an annual pattern could be seen, as both for tag 308 and 321 the autocorrelation reached a local maximum at a lag of around 350 days. (*get exact lag and reference figures*) Going further, the minimum of the autocorrelation occurs in winter. 
Thus, autocorrelation is a useful method to check if the assumptions about general vertical patterns (in the present case, the same vertical behaviour (resulting in a local autocorrelation maximum) every summer and a different behaviour (resulting in a local minimum) in winter). Potentially interesting are the points at which the autocorrelation is 0. This is the case at a lag (*insert exact lags and dates here*). It might be indicative of a behavioural switch. But this would only hold true in the case of behaviours that can be distinguishable from the depthlog. While it might not be the most resultful exploratory analysis it can be a helpful auxiliary tool to 1) explore the depth time series data and 2) potentially confirm identified periods with occurring behavioural switches.

Interpretation: The characteristics of the autocorrelations of the two depthlogs show similar patterns in time series between the female shark (tag 308) and the male shark (tag 321), indicating that their daily median depth is very similar in time periods of 3 - 5 weeks (that is, with lags below 24 to 35 days). Interestingly, both individuals show turning points in their autocorrelation (i.e., the autocorrelation goes from positive to negative values) at similar lag values, suggesting similar seasonal depth patterns. Furthermore, the local autocorrelation maximum is at similar lag days of about a year for both individuals, indicating an annual pattern in vertical behaviour.

<!-- overlay identified change periods with diff. step percentages and do `rgrid.arrange(p_acf_308, p_308_ribbon_rulsif_allpercent, ncol = 1)` and see where autocorrelation = 0 and the identified change periods match. -->

<!-- argue that the autocorrelation might even help deciding which step% should be right? -->

```{r rulsifacf}
#| include: true
#| label: fig-rulsifacf
#| layout-ncol: 1
#| out-width: 95%
#| fig-height: 3
#| fig-cap: "Rulsif results and autocorrelation plots"

gridExtra::grid.arrange(p_acf_321, p_321_rulsif_all, ncol = 1)

```

In @fig-rulsifacf-2 the time periods where the autocorrelation equals 0 match the migration periods very well. This is less the case for @fig-rulsifacf-1, but still there is some overlap between putative migration periods and the autocorrelation equaling 0.
An advantage of autocorrelation over machine learning algorithms is its simplicity. There are no model parameters to optimise, and the result is clear and unambiguous.
It would be of interest to plot the autocorrelation of more depthlogs in the future and assess the overlap with potential migration periods.

### FFT

The periodogram of tag 308 (female, see @fig-fft-2) has more peaks than that of tag 321 (male, see @fig-fft-3). The male mostly shows tidal periods (6, 12 and 24 hours), suggesting selective tidal stream transport as a driver for movement (*ref*). The use of tidal currents is well-known in benthic species, especially flatfish, but might also occur in demersal species like *M. asterias* (*ref*). Tag 308 (f) shows more peaks outside of potentially tide-related vertical movement behaviour, i.e., also peaks at 8, 23 and 25 hours. Since all of those periods are very close to tidal periods and their spectral density not very high it is unclear at this point if these peaks are because of artefacts during implementation of the fft-algorithm, or because the female showed different vertical behaviour than the male. Another possible reason could be the depth use of the female beyond the sensor range, i.e., in waters deeper than 68 m and the resulting measurement errors in the signal of continuous periods of 68 m depth.

### Continuous Wavelet Transform

it is surprising that no significant tidal periodicities of 6, 12 or 24h were detected in the wavelet scalograms of the raw depthlog. This could be due to resolution limits in the time domain, or due to the downsampling of measurements (from a 2 minute time interval to a 30 minute time interval).

##	Limits of biologging/ fish tagging

-	Geolocation modelling already leads to impressive results for comparatively well-studied species (e.g. cod (?), sea bass), but still limited in accuracy for not wellknown species

###	Limits of geolocation modelling

-	Boundary condition: max depth of fish per day == max depth of bathy for that day
-	Behavioural switch: migration/non-migration or migration/winter resident/summer resident

-	Resolution of bathymetry dataset
  -	Possible that shark was in certain area but bc bathymetry grid = summary (e.g. mean), geolocation model rules this location out (cf Woillez 2016)
-	Behaviour incorrectly/not inferred
  -	E.g. active vs inactive behaviour:
  
- talk about the geolocation model of @goossens_2023 and its limits?
  - there is one datapoint per day, masking daily location changes. 
  - knowing that M. asterias spends all its life on the seafloor, the maximum depth in the depthlog should not be shallower than the depth of the location for this day, since the opposite would imply that the animal swam in the water column
  - it most likely exhibits a somewhat residential behaviour with small horizontal movement during both summer and winter, and migratory behaviour for a short period
  
- argue how the geolocation model could overall be improved

### current state of fish tagging

-	It’s kind of the best we can do today, but non-satellite tagging methodologies have huge drawbacks still
-	Acoustic telemetry: high resolution on regional scale (i.e. where the receivers are placed) but outside of receiver networks: no knowledge at all

##	Limits of the chosen analysis methods

-	Wavelet analysis: no super fine scale analysis possible bc of limited res in both time and freq domain

##	Limits of the acoustic detection dataset {#sec-disclimitsacoustic}

-	There are ~10 000 detections within ~2 yrs but compared to other studies (ref to other studies!) this is not that much.
-	the horiz resolution of receivers, esp in/around the WS is not good bc rather receiver gate than array to monitor species swimming into/out of the Scheldt river (= different use case scenario: receiver array needed to resolve locations of sharks better, and to e.g. enable triangulation)

##	Limits of the data storage tag dataset

-	Female shark: deeper than tag depth limit (68m): geolocation model inaccurate, shark putatively went into the Hurd deep (MRGID: 3321) in English channel
-	Only one individual per sex: not reliable, no statistics possible

# Conclusion

*brief summary of the main findings (original data, lesson learned,…)*


# Outlook

<!-- *Alle kapitel aus der Einleitung wieder aufnehmen* -->

 -	maybe take hormone samples to infer if females pregnant or not during tagging?
 - place acoustic receiver at red buouy at Zoetelande to assess shark "aggregation" in summer

##	Acoustic detections additional analyses

-	Vertical space use: resolve individuals to see if there are differences between ind. Sharks


##	Improvements of geolocation model for M. asterias

- redo geolocation model with suggested changes and behavioural states

- compare and execute different analyses to infer behavioural states: retry STFT+HMM method by @heerah_2017, using the CWT outputs to segment the time series into different behaviours, like @soleymani_2017
